## After-Tax Performance

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> - The GIPS standards still view after-tax performance as [[supplemental information]] in a GIPS Report, correct? Do you have any examples of after-tax calculation methodologies and benchmarks used?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> GIPS still considers after-tax performance as supplemental information. CFAI is considering creating updated after-tax guidance. There is the old [USIPC Guidance](https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/corporate-record/usipc-after-tax-performance-standards.pdf) that still has examples of portfolios and benchmarks calculations. [[4.A.18]]

## Benchmarks

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> One of the strategies/composite’s [[benchmark]] is only available on a price-only basis from the benchmark vendor. Can the firm use the price-only benchmark with a suitable disclaimer in a GIPS Report and market to prospective clients?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> - Firms must not present a price only benchmark, even if there is no appropriate total return benchmark. The firm must disclose why no benchmark is provided. [[1.A.18]], [[1.A.19]]
> - A price only benchmark *may* be presented **only** as [[supplemental information]] and if it’s presented in addition to a total return benchmark.

## Calculations

### Question 1

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> What if the composite is calculated with daily returns?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> CFAI recommends that membership is static through out the month, and changes only happen monthly. Then the daily composite calculations are linked together for the monthly return. [[2.A.24]]

### Question 2

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Consider a US equity centric composite with multiple portfolios, all of which are domestic (US based). When a new non-US domiciled account is added to this composite, the performance of the non-US domiciled account will lag the US based accounts due to the specific dividend taxation withholding that the non-US domiciled account is subject to (assuming the investment strategy is exactly the same for the US and non-US clients).
> 
> Given the dividend withholding drag in performance created by the client domicile (which is beyond investment management control), is it permissible to create composite performance for the non-US domiciled account using the same tax tables used by all the other domestic accounts in the composite?
> 
> The outcome is the tax effects of a different tax regime is eliminated from composite performance, and composite dispersion is also reduced.

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> The Standards do not specify which types of returns should be presented. In this case, you could consider who the prospect is. If it’s a US prospect, you could show it gross of withholding tax of all portfolios. If it’s to a European client, you could show a mix of both gross and net of withholding tax, and disclose the percentage of assets that are net of withholding tax. But it’s easiest to just always show gross of withholding tax. [[4.C.25]], [[5.C.24]]

### Question 3

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> We have been calculating the [[External Standard Deviation#Ex Post Standard Deviation (External)|3-year standard deviation]] using *population*. Recently we onboarded a new system that calculates the 3-year standard deviation using *sample*. This has been a debatable topic, but does CFA Institute have any preference? What do most firms use?
> 
> If we have to change from *population* to *sample*, do we need to disclose it in the GIPS Reports? Will updating the policies and procedures to note the change in calculation be sufficient?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> - Most firms use *population*. CFA believes *population* is the best practice.
> - CFA thinks **a change in methodology is immaterial** and would not need to be disclosed on the reports. Just update the policies and procedures.

### Question 4

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> We include mutual funds in our composites, and they are sub advised funds. The mutual funds only have NAV returns. We are grossing up the NAV returns by expense ratios and then net them down by model fees to get net returns. Can we use Total Net Assets for the fund assets under “Composite Assets”? Composite Assets are usually before fees, but Total Net Assets are after fees. If we can, do we need to disclose the fact that fund assets are after fees?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> Most firms use Net Assets. If you use a particular share class for performance, it is recommended to use net assets of all share classes in calculating composite assets. There is no required disclosure for this.

## Composite Construction

### Question 1

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> If a firm offers a strategy both as separate accounts and as a pooled fund, can it also maintain separate composites, one composite for the separate accounts and one composite for the pooled fund? Although the investment objectives and the fundamental investment decisions are the same, due to fundamentally different fee structures and the fact that there are frequent in-flows, the implementation of the strategy in the pooled fund must be adapted accordingly and the returns achieved may therefore differ.

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> You can’t create composites based only on fee types or legal structure. Cash flow requirements and implementation may be a reason to create a separate composite. [[3.A.5 Composite Definition Hierarchy#Portfolio Types/Legal Structure]]

### Question 2

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> We are looking to classify all our equity funds in one composite i.e., India Equity Composite (strategy is different but we will be investing in Indian stocks only). Can we do that as the investment philosophy for selecting stocks is the same?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed to a similar investment mandate or strategy. In this instance, it seems as though there are some general equity portfolios, and this firm wants to add in a portfolio that only has Indian equity. You probably should not do this because the portfolios need to be managed to the same strategy. For ex. If you had a small cap equity portfolio, mid cap equity portfolio, and large cap equity portfolio, you would not include all of those in the same composite because the strategies are very different. [[3.A.5 Definition Guiding Principles]]

### Question 3

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Is it possible to have a GIPS Composite consisting of multiple portfolios that are managed according to the same strategy but in different hedged currencies?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> We would argue that these need to be in different composites. Even with perfect hedging, you will still have differences in the cost of the hedging, and over time, that can be significant. [[3.A.5 Composite Definition Hierarchy#Currencies]]

### Question 4

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> We have an incubator fund with live seed money in it that has not been marketed yet. It is the only member of the GIPS composite.
> 1. If we close this incubator fund, does the composite performance restart if the fund is re-opened at a later date?
> 2. Alternatively, if we sell all of the holdings and go to 100% cash, does the performance re-start once we fully re-invest the cash? And if so, does it need to remain in cash for a minimum length of time before performance can restart?
> 3. Are there any other circumstances in which the performance of the composite is restarted?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> - Yes.
> - The fund would leave the composite when it goes to 100% cash, then it would rejoin when it is reinvested back to the strategy.
> - Composite minimums or SCFs that cause the only portfolio to leave. The only portfolio losing discretion such as Tax Loss Harvesting.

> [!SUMMARY] Personal Observation
> 
> It was not discussed, but I believe the way around this is if it’s truly a fund as the question stated rather than a portfolio like the panelists discussed because funds do not have to go into composites, so there would potentially have no history to retain. [[3.A.3]]

### Question 5

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Are we required to review composites that closed more than 5 years ago to see if a new account would reopen the composite? (In relation to Composite List Requirement [[1.A.22]])

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> You are required to check for composites up to 10 years old, because that’s the length of time presented on GIPS Reports. So there would be a large break in performance. [[3.A.9]]

> [!SUMMARY] Personal Opinion
> 
> You might be able to find that the strategy is materially different enough to be defined differently and create a new composite.

### Question 6

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> The Standards say you can close a composite if a firm is not offering the strategy to segregated accounts, but the standards also say that all discretionary accounts must be included in at least one composite. How do we understand that?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> You can’t close a composite that includes a segregated account, but then the firm decides not to offer the strategy anymore. The only time the composite can be closed is if the composite no longer has any segregated accounts in it, so it’s either empty or only has pooled funds. [[3.A.2]]

## Error Correction

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Are prospective corrections allowed for immaterial errors? We have a case where a portfolio should have been included in a composite from the inception of the portfolio but was mistakenly marked as non-discretionary. We would like to make the correction prospectively from when the performance team is notified of the error. Would we be offside with the GIPS standards if we make prospective corrections for immaterial errors?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> No. You should follow your error correction policies, which may allow for things to be included prospectively. The analysis should be done though to determine if it is actually immaterial. [[1.A.21]]

## Firm Definition

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Can a firm have multiple definitions of a firm? For example, a parent company is defined, but a subsidiary has its own definition while being included in the parent firm.

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> There should only one definition of the firm. A subsidiary can’t be included, but also have its own claim of compliance. All of the subsidiaries may have their own, but they can’t roll up into one larger firm. [[1.A.2]] [[DISTINCT BUSINESS ENTITY]]

## Full Performance Measurement Period

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Composites must include only those portfolios that are managed for the full performance measurement period for which the composite return is calculated. What is the “full performance measurement period”?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> The period for which performance is calculated. For example, if the composite is calculated monthly, those portfolios managed for the month are included.

> [!SUMMARY] Personal Opinion
> 
> I’d personally take this to mean daily inclusion and exclusion policies are fine, allowing portfolios to influence performance for partial months. **However, CFAI recommends monthly inclusion and exclusion policies because of the operational burden and being able to justify a particular day over another.** [[3.A.8]]

## GIPS Reports

### Question 1

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> The GIPS standards say that it is permissible to generate [[NET-OF-FEES]] returns by subtracting the highest fee applicable to a prospective client. Does this mean that it is permissible to produce more than one [[GIPS Report]] for the same composite, each reflecting a different management charge dependent on the type/size of client?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> You are allowed to generate more than one GIPS report with different net returns. In the Marketing Rule session, it was also discussed that you could include multiple return streams in one report.

### Question 2

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Is it required for [[GIPS REPORT|GIPS REPORTS]] to be called "GIPS Reports" or can they be called another name such as "Composite Reports" as an example?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> You are not required to label it a GIPS Report. In Appendix A of the Handbook, they do not use that in the heading.

### Question 3

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> A firm has a new [[Limited Distribution Pooled Fund]]. The Fund will join its respective Composite in February of the new year, due to significant cash flows in the final months of the previous year/start of the new year, therefore the fund is not included in the [[Composite]] at the previous year end. To meet the requirement to provide a GIPS Report to prospective investors, is it appropriate to provide the GIPS Composite Report from the end of the previous year end to Prospective Investors in the Limited Distribution Pooled Fund, if the TER and Management Fee are included within the report?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> The CFAI is assuming that the fund was in the composite and was removed due to SCFs, but it otherwise a member, and will rejoin at the start of the year. In this instance, the firm should give the Composite report to the LDPF prospective investor along with the appropriate fee schedule and total expense ratio. [[1.B.7]]

### Question 4

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> When is it appropriate for a firm to disclose only month and year for [[composite creation date]] and [[composite inception date]]?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> - For inception date, the firm should also include the day to indicate when performance started.
> 
> - Inception date doesn’t matter as much, especially for older composites. But it’s recommended to include the day.

### Question 5

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> Are we required to track GIPS Report distribution?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> It is encouraged, but it is not required. You still need to make every reasonable effort to reissue a GIPS Report with a material error to those that received it. [[1.A.20]], [[1.A.21]]

## Inception Date

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> We have a single account composite, and the only account of the composite got funded on 15 April 2019. The account inclusion policy for the composite is “New accounts are included into the composite after the first full month under management”. Going by this rationale, we included the account in the composite on 1 June 2019 and defined 1 June 2019 as the [[COMPOSITE INCEPTION DATE|composite’s Inception Date]] i.e., the date on which the track record of the composite started. However, we want to change the inception date of the composite to 15 April 2019 without changing the Account Inclusion Policy of the composite. Can we do this?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> Yes, but only if it’s the only one because it’s a weighting issue. In this instance, the composite inception date would be revised. It would be considered a significant event that must be disclosed. The policies and procedures should also be updated to reflect the new inclusion policy. [[3.A.7]], [[4.C.19]]

## Real Estate

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> If you have the situation where Real Estate accounts are each in a single account Composite, the Composites being individually defined by strategy and vintage year. Is it appropriate that those accounts can also belong to another Composite, defined by Strategy, but not vintage year – even though the accounts have different vintage years?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> You include portfolios based on the composite definition, and there is no requirement that it includes a vintage year qualification. [[3.A.5 Composite Definition Hierarchy#Inception Date]]

## Valuation

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> For a given fixed income asset class, if a firm changes their pricing provider during the year and this change impacts the returns, what is the best option:
> - View 1 is that the firm should measure performance based on their beginning market value (and original pricing provider) and their ending market value (and new pricing provider). The change in provider is directly impacting performance, although it's not due to any sort of portfolio management decisions.
>  - View 2 is that the firm should measure based on pro forma valuations that back out the impact of the provider changes from the current year, as it's not reflective of any actual portfolio management or construction decisions. The firm would then have some sort of footnote to explain in detail in the GIPS Reports

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> Fixed income almost always has this problem just due to the nature of vendors. View 1 is the method seen by the panelist. There was one instance they saw a firm try the second, but it was very complicated math. And if a firm decides to take this route, it is recommended to disclose the impact this had. GIPS doesn’t give an exact answer, but you can say GIPS is disclosure focused with performance a secondary item. [[2.A.20]]

## Wrap Fee Portfolios

> [!QUESTION]
> 
> In the Guidance Statement of Wrap Fee Portfolios, it is stated that, “If the firm cannot determine the appropriate wrap fee to use, it may use as the model fee the generally assumed highest model wrap fee (currently 3.00% for equities and 1.50% for fixed income.)” It is our understanding that many firms are now defaulting to 3.00% and 1.50%, respectively. As the guidance statement was issued in 2021, is it the CFA Institute’s position that these are still current and appropriate to use?

> [!ANSWER]
> 
> CFAI’s position is that these amounts are still correct. They asked around to many firms and platforms and could not find instances of something higher than 3%. But they believe that even if there was one firm out there doing something higher, that it would still be fine to 3% given that the overwhelming majority support 3%. [[4.C.11]], [[WRAP FEE]]
