# SEC Marketing Rule
## Personal Notes
- [[sector performance]] is likely considered performance
- [[attribution analysis]] is unlikely to be considered performance
- [[performance contribution]] to return is gray area
- they tend to view performance as whether an investor would see the information is how many dollars they made
- statistics like [[Sharpe Ratio]] are unlikely performance, but you should probably disclose if it's using gross or net
- always show net even if it doesn't make sense
	- there may be cases where a sector net return is better than the gross because it's almost like a credit back to the fund, reduces fee load (negative gross performance)
- methodologies should be consistent across funds/sectors, put it in policy manual
- when showing [[extracted performance]], you don't need to show every piece of the performance, but it should have fair and balanced criteria of what you show
	- so excluding, for example, a deal that is less than a year old is permissible
- stitching performance of rep accounts could be a problem. It is [[hypothetical performance]] , and needs to follow those rules
- many characteristics like attribution are not performance, and wouldn't fall under the rule
- show composite performance, show characteristics using [[representative account|rep portfolio]]
- if a [[database]] or other forms only have one field and ask for gross, only giving gross is fine, try to give disclosures as you can
- [[restatement|restating]] past performance to the current [[FEE SCHEDULE]] can be done in advertising if it's targeted to an appropriate audience. If it's more general audience, it's more appropriate to do the highest model fee available. For [[GIPS REPORT|GIPS REPORTS]], it has to past the [[2.A.31|test]] regardless of method used.
