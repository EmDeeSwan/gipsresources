# Developing a Database Strategy
## Personal Notes
- uploading data to a [[Database]] past the 10-12th business day is almost considered late, performance on the 5th is great
- don't recommend copy pasting the [[GIPS REPORT]] disclosures directly to the database. Upload the GIPS Report, and make reference to the full disclosure on the database
- screening activity starts as soon as the quarter ends, or month ends, and you miss most opportunities if you upload past the 12th business day
- 50-80% of managers hit that 12th business day mark
- [[eVestment]] doesn't push material error updates if we upload new material, but users may opt into that notification. It isn't commonly used
- most screeners are looking at monthly cadence for uploads, not monthly results on a quarterly basis, but screens are updated automatically if we do upload something
