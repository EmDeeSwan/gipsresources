# GIPS Helpdesk Update
## Personal Notes
- if you include non fee paying accounts after a specific date, it would be considered as a composite redefinition
- when a redefinition happens, you only need the date and describe the change. You don't need to list the full old description on the report
	- most common occurrence is with [[Wrap Account|wrap accounts]]. Start with [[Institutional Account|institutional accounts]], then drop the institutional and start including the wrap [[3.A.14]]
- cant have an [[SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW|SCF]] Policy that is based on how many accounts are in the composite
- for [[GIPS REPORT|GIPS REPORTS]] that include year to date, less than a year, only returns on the table are required, all other stats are not required
- if a composite closed more than 10 years ago, but reopens, the old track record does not need to be shown.
- [[1.A.37]] requires us to tell prospects in marketing material where the GIPS Report is. Stating it's in appendix is fine, like in a table of contents
- portfolio drift isn't ground for moving to a new composite if there's no client direction. You might have to consider composite redefinition if it's a systemic issue
