For the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, an advertisement includes any materials that are distributed to or designed for use in newspapers, magazines, firm brochures, pooled fund fact sheets, pooled fund offering documents, letters, media, websites, or any other written or electronic material distributed to more than one party, and there is no contact between the firm and the reader of the advertisement. One-on-one presentations and individual client reporting are not considered advertisements.
