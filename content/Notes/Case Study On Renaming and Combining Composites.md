# Case Study On Renaming and Combining Composites

> [!INFO]- The Original Bond Composite Definitions
> > [!INFO]- US Total Return Bond Composite Definition
> > The US Total Return Bond Composite is a diversified bond strategy that seeks to maximize total return via a combination of income and capital appreciation. It invests primarily in US intermediate-term bonds, but can also invest outside of the benchmark in below investment-grade, emerging markets, and nondollar debt (hedged and unhedged).
> > **Benchmark:** Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index
> > 
> > **General Portfolio Characteristics**
> > - Features flexible investment guidelines and a larger tracking error budget to more efficiently allocate risk and optimize returns in different markets environments
> > - Up to 35% of assets can be rated below investment grade
> > - Although focused on US issuers, up to 20% of the portfolio can consist of nondollar bonds and currencies
> > - Duration is generally managed within +/- 50% of the benchmark
> > - The strategy utilizes on a regular basis a variety of derivative instruments such as, but not limited to, currency forwards, fixed income futures, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, credit default swaps, synthetic indices, and options on all mentioned instruments, primarily to hedge certain market risks associated with the strategy's objective, to express directional opportunities on specific markets and to facilitate liquidity management

## Situation
The Fixed Income Team and Marketing Team requested that the existing **US Total Return Bond** composite gets renamed as *US Core Plus Bond*, and that the currently existing **US Core Plus Bond** is *eliminated*. They believed the benefits of doing this were that:
- Consultant Relations believes this will help alleviate confusion as prospects and consultants search databases, because the Firm only has one offering in the "Core Plus" category
- The Firm would not lose the existing track record of the Total Return composite, nor will the Firm have to include the two legacy Core Plus separate accounts in the "new" Core Plus composite
	- While the performance of the two legacy accounts will not be included in the composite, the Firm would be allowed to include their AUM at the Core Plus strategy level in databases
- The Firm will **not** be renaming or rebranding their Total Return Fund or ETF
- The Total Return Fund would remain the representative account for the "new" Core Plus composite.

## Response
The issue is that the Firm can't simply combine or switch existing composites with name changes or eliminate composites that won't be marketed. This doesn't mean we can't approach the desired solution though.

- A [[COMPOSITE]] is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed to a similar investment mandate. What that mandate entails is contained in the [[COMPOSITE DEFINITION]].
	- There is also the [[COMPOSITE DESCRIPTION]], which is essentially a summary of the full Definition.
	- Marketing needs do not determine whether or not a composite is created, but can inform the Definition.
- Composites may be broadly or narrowly defined, but all accounts that meet the definition must be included.
	- Composite Definitions should be unique and show a distinction from other accounts.
	- Definitions may determine what, if any, restrictions on portfolios are allowed.
		- It's possible for a portfolio to be included in both a broadly and narrowly defined composite, but ultimately depends on the broader Composite Definition.
	- The spirit of GIPS is to prevent cherry picking of accounts and returns, but also to have meaningful representation of the types of strategies managed by the firm. Composites should have meaningful Definitions to avoid either extreme.
- The Definition may be changed, but may not be applied retroactively, but it is also generally discouraged to change the Definition, and the Firm should instead create a new composite. There are many nuances that may be discussed.
	- The Definitions at the Firm have been poor historically, and it is not uncommon to have carbon copies of Definitions. There may be slight deviations in the composites' Composite Descriptions, but any deviations should have also been included in the Definition.
- All GIPS discretionary, segregated accounts must be in at least one composite.
	- The "discretionary" qualifier makes this a bit of a gray area.
		- Is a portfolio with a one-of-a-kind strategy discretionary? Maybe not.
		- Does a second portfolio of the same or very similar strategy warrant the creation of a composite? Probably.

Now getting to the three bond composites in question. **US Core Bond** and **US Core Plus Bond** are defined the same way, and only have *slight* differences in the Description. Also interestingly, **US Core Bond** was named *US Core Plus Limited*, which would seem to imply it was similar to US Core Plus, even ignoring the Definitions. **US Total Return Bond** has parts of its Definition that are different, but others that are word for word the same (not a problem, as there's enough differentiation in the other parts, but it's a useful observation to keep in mind).

Now, if I were to apply the GIPS principles outlined above with how the composites are currently defined, I would assume the membership of **US Core Bond** and **US Core Plus Bond** to be practically identical. This is not the case though, so clearly one or both of those composites need to have their Definition refined to reflect how all accounts historically and into the present have been managed. However, given that the accounts in **US Core Plus Bond** are together, they should remain in a composite together (whether that's the current composite or new composite). **US Total Return Bond** is defined differently, and the membership does not overlap the other composites, so that is as it is expected.

## Action Items
Assuming that none of the composites are being combined, these are the action items we'd need are for the current three composites or any new items:
- Have their definitions revised so that they're distinct in a way that would exclude the accounts from the other composites and only include the respective membership history in a way that accurately describes how the accounts were and are managed
- Update the Description so it's a summary of the revised Definition
- If there are name changes, we want to document why the change occurred.
	- If a composite is taking over a name of another composite, justification as to why it's appropriate and why those two (or even the third) composites shouldn't be merged.
- It could be determined that a new composite is created that housed two or all three of these composites. It would retain the history back to the earliest account.
	- If this is the action taken, we'd need a new Definition, name, etc. If there are any surviving composites, those Definitions would still need to be reviewed.
