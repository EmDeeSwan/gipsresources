# Annualized Return
## Definition
A measure of how much an investment has increased on average each year during a specific period. The annualized return is calculated as a geometric average to show what the annual return compounded would look like.
## Calculation
The formula for calculating annualized performance is as follows:

where _R_ is the cumulative return for the period and _n_ is the number of years in the period.

For example, assume a compositeâ€™s cumulative return for a five-year period is 150.0%. It has a five-year average annual compound return, or annualized return, of 20.11%, which is calculated as:

If instead the 150% is achieved over 12.5 years, the 12.5-year average annual compound return, or annualized return, is 7.61%, which is calculated as:

If the composite experiences a break in the track record, the periods before and after the break must not be linked, and annualized returns must not be calculated across the break in performance.
