# External Standard Deviation
## Calculation Methods
### Ex Post Standard Deviation (External)
Ex post standard deviation is calculated as follows:

where _R<sub>i</sub>_ is the return on the _i_ th monthly composite or benchmark return, _n_ is the number of monthly returns used for the external standard deviation calculation (the use of _n_ is best practice and preferable, but either _n_ or _n_ – 1 in the denominator of the standard deviation calculation is acceptable), and _MEAN(R)_ is the mean monthly return of the composite or the benchmark over the period for which the external standard deviation is being calculated, where

where _R<sub>1</sub>_ is the monthly composite or benchmark return, _R<sub>i</sub>_ is the _i_ th monthly composite or benchmark return, and _n_ is the number of returns used in the calculation (required to be 36 monthly returns to satisfy this requirement).

Firms are required to select a methodology (i.e., the use of _n_ or _n_ – 1) on a composite-specific basis, document it in their policies and procedures, and consistently apply that methodology.

To annualize the three-year ex post standard deviation calculated using monthly returns, the result of the foregoing standard deviation formula must be multiplied by the square root of 12.

If the firm presents only gross-of-fees returns in the GIPS Composite Report, the firm should use gross-of-fees returns to calculate the external standard deviation. If a firm presents only net-of-fees returns in the GIPS Composite Report, the firm should use net-of-fees returns to calculate the external standard deviation. If the firm presents both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees returns, it is recommended that the firm use gross-of-fees returns to calculate the external standard deviation. (See Provision [[2.B.7]].) The firm must disclose which returns (gross-of-fees or net-of-fees) were used to calculate the external standard deviation. (See Provision [[4.C.44]] or Provision [[6.C.35]])
