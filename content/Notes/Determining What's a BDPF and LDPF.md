# Determining What's a BDPF and LDPF
## Personal Notes
The CFA Institute released the GIPS 2020 Standards in June 2019, but the handbook with full length discussions and examples was not released until early 2020. This left a gap where firms were trying to navigate the intricacies between [[BROAD DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND|BROAD DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUNDS]] and [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND|LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUNDS]]. Therefore, some of the sources used here were published before the full handbook provided them with better information; the source publish dates are given. However, I felt that the content was useful context in solving the question today and demonstrating the gray area that we might be working in.

The primary guidance on determining what is a BDPF or a LDPF is contained in the Discussion of [[1.A.13#Table of Pooled Fund Classifications|1.A.13]]. The main factor for setting apart LDPFs it is offered exclusively through [[One-On-One Presentation|one-on-one presentations]].

The fund's general availability can be misleading when comparing them to a "Broad" vs "Limited" Distribution in a GIPS sense. A fund could be regulated in a way that shares are available to the general public, but the firm has chosen to only offer an institutional share class. This looks like something that is broadly distributed but to a limited scope of investors. Depending on how this is marketed would determine how GIPS views the fund. If it is marketed in a variety of ways, it would be a [[BROAD DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]]. If it is marketed solely in [[One-On-One Presentation|one-on-one presentations]], then it would be a [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]]. Even if the firm creates retail share classes, broadening the scope of investors even more at first glance, if it is marketed *solely* through [[One-On-One Presentation|one-on-one presentations]], then it is still classified as a [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]].

When considering limited pools of investors, such as investors with retirement accounts, who has the investment discretion is the determining factor. If the individual investors are choosing funds for their retirement accounts, then it would be a [[BROAD DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]]. If the fund is being marketed with a [[One-On-One Presentation]] to the plan sponsor who make investment decisions on behalf of the beneficiaries, then it would be considered a [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]].

### Case Study on a Firm's Common Trust Funds (CTFs)
The Common Trust Funds (CTFs) being managed are only available through qualified retirement plans that are subject to ERISA. They are not available in non-qualified retirement plans, like deferred compensation plans. An investor would have to be employed by a company that offers a qualified plan with CTFs in the line up in order to have access to it.

The Firm's GIPS Team was not able to determine how these CTFs were marketed and who made the decision to invest. Because the LDPF has the stricter requirement, that a [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]] must be provided, the Firm took the conservative approach in classifying them as LDPFs.

> LDPFs are defined as any pooled fund that is not a broad distribution pooled fund (e.g., hedge funds, CITs). If the fund is only offered through direct sales with investors and/or investors enter into an agreement directly with the firm, then the fund is considered an LDPF. Additionally, pooled funds are considered LDPFs that are regulated under a framework that would permit the general public to purchase or hold shares, but where the firm has chosen to offer institutional share classes only and all share classes are sold exclusively in one-on-one presentations.

> The 2020 Standards permit managers of broad distribution pooled funds (“**BDPF**”) (_e.g._, U.S. registered funds or UCITS) and limited distribution pooled funds (“**LDPF**”) (_e.g._, U.S. private funds and AIFs) to present GIPS-compliant performance reports at the pooled fund level. This represents a significant change from the 2010 Standards, which require firms to create single-fund composites if a pooled fund does not meet the definition of any existing composite. Under the 2020 Standards, managers may avoid preparation of a report for a BDPF entirely if the BDPF’s strategy is not offered to separate account clients. Alternatively, if the BDPF’s strategy is offered to separate account clients, the BDPF must be included in the applicable composite(s) (which need not be delivered to potential investors in the BDPF).

> LDPFs are those pooled funds that cannot be classified as a BDPF. To put it another way, LDPFs are generally private funds, such as a hedge fund, a private equity fund, a limited partnership, or a collective investment trust.

> Broad distribution pooled fund (BDPF): Firm sells participation in a specific fund. Typically, no direct contact between the firm and the pooled fund investor. Regulated under a framework that would permit the general public to purchase or hold the pooled fund’s shares. Not exclusively offered in one-on-one presentations.
