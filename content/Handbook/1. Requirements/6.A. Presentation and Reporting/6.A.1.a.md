# 6.A.1.a
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]]:
- At least five years of performance (or for the period since the POOLED FUND INCEPTION DATE if the POOLED FUND has been in existence less than five years) that meets the REQUIREMENTS of the GIPS standards. After the FIRM presents a minimum of five years of GIPS-compliant performance (or for the period since the POOLED FUND INCEPTION DATE if the POOLED FUND has been in existence less than five years), the FIRM MUST present an additional year of performance each year, building up to a minimum of 10 years of GIPS-compliant performance.
## Discussion
To claim compliance, a firm is required to meet all applicable requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis for at least a five-year period, or since inception of the firm if the firm has been in existence for less than five years. When initially claiming compliance with the GIPS standards, a firm must present a minimum of five years of pooled fund performance or performance since the inception of the pooled fund if the pooled fund has been in existence for less than five years.

Once the firm has its initial minimum five years of GIPS-compliant history, the firm must continue to add annual returns to each GIPS Pooled Fund Report, so that five years after initially claiming compliance with the GIPS standards, the firm will have a 10-year performance record for its pooled funds. It is recommended that firms present a pooled fund’s history for more than the minimum required periods. (See Provision [[6.B.6]])
