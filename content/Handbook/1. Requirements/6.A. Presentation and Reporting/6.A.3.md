Links: [[6. Pooled Fund Time-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 6.A.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST clearly label or identify:
- The periods that are presented.
- If [[POOLED FUND]] returns are [[POOLED FUND GROSS RETURN|POOLED FUND GROSS RETURNS]] or [[POOLED FUND NET RETURN|POOLED FUND NET RETURNS]].
## Discussion
All periods presented in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report must be clearly labeled or identified. This includes annual periods, partial-year periods, and any additional periods presented.

Firms may present either pooled fund gross returns or pooled fund net returns in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report and may also choose to present both pooled fund gross returns and pooled fund net returns. For prospective investors to understand the nature of the returns being presented, all returns presented must be clearly labeled or identified as gross returns or net returns.
