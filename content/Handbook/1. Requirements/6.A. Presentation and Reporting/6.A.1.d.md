# 6.A.1.d
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]]:
- When the POOLED FUND terminates, the return from the last annual period end through the POOLED FUND TERMINATION DATE.
## Discussion
The GIPS standards require that returns from the last annual period end through the pooled fund termination date be presented for pooled funds with a termination date of 1 January 2011 or later. Assume that a firm presents pooled fund returns for annual periods ended 31 December and a pooled fund terminates so that the track record ends 31 August 2017. The GIPS Pooled Fund

Report for this pooled fund must include the pooled fund return for the period from 1 January 2017 through 31 August 2017. Partial-year returns must not be annualized. As an example, a pooled fund that terminates on 31 January 2020 and has a one-month return for January 2020 of 3% (which equates to an annualized return of 42.6%) would be required to present that 3% as the partial year’s performance.

The annualized return of 42.6% must not be presented. Some spreadsheet and software applications automatically annualize all returns, and firms are reminded that for periods of less than a year, the firm must “de-annualize” any annualized returns that are calculated.

The method chosen to de-annualize a return is at the discretion of the firm, but it must be a geometric calculation. In the situation just presented, the 42.6% annualized return could be de-annualized by one of the following formulas:

both resulting in a non-annualized one-month return of 3%.
