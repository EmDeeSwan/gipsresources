## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose changes to the name of the POOLED FUND. This disclosure MUST be included for a minimum of one year and for as long as it is relevant to interpreting the track record.
## Discussion
When prospective investors are evaluating pooled funds over time and across firms, it is important that they understand exactly which pooled funds they are assessing. If a firm changes the name of a pooled fund, the change must be disclosed in the GIPS Pooled Fund Report. The name change must be disclosed for a minimum of one year and potentially for more than one year if the firm determines the disclosure is still relevant and meaningful. The firm must consider the underlying principles of the GIPS standards, which are fair representation and full disclosure, when determining how long the disclosure will be included in the GIPS Pooled Fund Report.

### Sample Disclosure:
“As of 1 January 2016, the XYZ Index Pooled Fund was renamed the US Equity Large Cap Pooled Fund.”
