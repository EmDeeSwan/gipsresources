## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose the use of a SUB-ADVISOR and the periods a SUB-ADVISOR was used.
## Discussion
Some firms use a sub-advisor to manage part or all of a particular strategy. For example, if a firm specializes in managing equities, it might hire a sub-advisor (a third-party investment manager) to manage the fixed-income portion of its balanced portfolios. The GIPS standards require that firms include the performance of pooled fund assets assigned to a sub-advisor in the respective pooled fund’s performance. In the spirit of full disclosure, a firm must disclose the fact that a sub-advisor was used in the management of the pooled fund and the periods for which a sub-advisor was used. It is not necessary to disclose the name of the sub-advisor. This is required for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
### Sample Disclosures:
“A sub-advisor is used to manage the international equity allocation of the Asia Growth Balanced Fund.”

“A sub-advisor was used for the management of the Targeted Duration Fixed Income Pooled Fund from its inception in 2001 through 31 December 2018.”
