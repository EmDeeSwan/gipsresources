# 6.C.35
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if [[POOLED FUND GROSS RETURN|POOLED FUND GROSS RETURNS]] or [[POOLED FUND NET RETURN|POOLED FUND NET RETURNS]] are used to calculate presented risk measures.
## Discussion
To help prospective investors interpret the risk measures presented in a GIPS Pooled Fund

Report, the firm must disclose which returns are used in the calculation of the presented risk measures. This applies to both required risk measures (e.g., the three-year annualized ex post standard deviation) and any additional risk measures. As discussed in Provision [[2.B.7]], it is recommended that firms use gross returns for pooled funds when calculating risk measures.
### Sample Disclosures:
“Pooled fund gross returns were used to calculate the three-year annualized ex post standard deviation of the pooled fund.”

“Gross returns were used to calculate all risk measures presented in this GIPS Pooled Fund Report.”

“Pooled fund net returns were used to calculate the three-year annualized ex post standard deviation of the pooled fund.”
