## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if preliminary, estimated values are used to determine [[FAIR VALUE]].
## Discussion
The use of preliminary, estimated values as fair value is common for some alternative strategies, including those that invest in underlying funds for which the firm relies on valuations provided by the underlying fund managers. When using preliminary, estimated values as fair value, it is important to remember the underlying principles of the GIPS standards: fair representation and full disclosure. If using preliminary, estimated values, firms must disclose this fact in the relevant GIPS Pooled Fund Report.

Firms that use preliminary, estimated values to determine fair value and subsequently change valuations when final values are received must determine how the firm’s error correction policies will be applied. (Please see Provision [[1.A.20]] for guidance on error correction policies.) Differences between the final and estimated values are not necessarily errors but are treated in a similar manner because the correction of previously presented information may be involved.

In addition to this required disclosure, it is recommended (see Provision [[6.B.8]]) that firms present the percentage of assets in the pooled fund that were valued using preliminary, estimated values as of each annual period end. This information will help prospective investors to interpret the performance record.
### Sample Disclosure:
