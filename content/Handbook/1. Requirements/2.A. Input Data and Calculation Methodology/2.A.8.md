## Standard for Firms
TOTAL RETURNS MUST be used.
## Discussion
Total return, which is measured over a specified period, has two components:

2. the income earned on the assets in the portfolio over the specified period.
When calculating the performance of a portfolio, firms are required to use a total return.
