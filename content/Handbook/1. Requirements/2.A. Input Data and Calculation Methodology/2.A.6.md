## Standard for Firms
When calculating [[OVERLAY EXPOSURE]], the FIRM MUST:
- Use the notional exposure of the [[OVERLAY STRATEGY]] PORTFOLIOS, the value of the underlying PORTFOLIOS being overlaid, or a specified target exposure.
- Use the same method for all PORTFOLIOS within a [[COMPOSITE]].
## Discussion
For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020, there are three allowable methods for calculating overlay exposure. Overlay exposure must be calculated by using:
- the notional exposure of the overlay strategy portfolios being managed,
- the value of the underlying portfolios being overlaid, or
- a specified target exposure.

The same method for calculating overlay exposure must be used for all portfolios within a composite.

For periods ending prior to 1 January 2020, these same methods may be used, but firms are not required to use these methods.
