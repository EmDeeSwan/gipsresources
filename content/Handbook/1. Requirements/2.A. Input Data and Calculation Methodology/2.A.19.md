# 2.A.19
## Standard for Firms
PORTFOLIOS MUST be valued in accordance with the definition of FAIR VALUE.
## Discussion
The quality of a return depends on the quality of the valuations included in the calculation of that return. Performance reporting is of little value unless the underlying valuations are based on sound valuation principles. Beginning 1 January 2011, portfolio valuations must be based on fair value.

Fair value is defined as the amount at which an investment could be sold in an arm’s length transaction between willing parties in an orderly transaction. The valuation must be determined using the objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, if available. In the absence of an objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, the valuation must represent the firm’s best estimate of the fair value. Fair value must include any accrued income.

As noted in the definition of fair value, when determining fair value, firms must use the objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date, if available. Markets are not always liquid, however, and investment prices are not always objective and/or observable. For illiquid or hard-to-value investments, or for investments for which no observable market value or market price is available, additional steps are necessary. A firm’s valuation policies and procedures must address situations in which the market prices may be available for similar but not identical investments, inputs to valuations are subjective rather than objective, and/or markets are inactive instead of active.

A very small number of circumstances exist in which cost or book value may be deemed to be fair value. Examples include stable value assets, such as guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) or real estate in the first year of the purchase of the property. In such cases, if a firm can support a determination that cost or book value and fair value are the same, it is acceptable for book value to be used when calculating asset values and returns.

It is important that a firm establish fair valuation policies that take into account the specific characteristics of asset classes or investment products. For example, to fair value an international pooled fund might require a firm to roll forward the valuation of the fund to the local market, in order to strike a Net Asset Value (NAV) based on more current prices than the local market close prices.

There is a recommended valuation hierarchy in provision [[2.B.6]]. Firms are not required to follow the valuation hierarchy, but it is recommended that they do so.

Although a firm may use external third parties to value investments, the firm still retains responsibility for compliance with the GIPS standards, which includes the requirement to fairly value investments. Over time, the type of valuation required and the minimum valuation frequency have changed. Prior editions of the GIPS standards included valuation guidance specific to private equity.  
The 2020 edition of the GIPS standards has no private equity-specific requirements. Instead, private equity is included in the broader category of private market investments. Please see the historical valuation requirements for various asset classes in the following exhibit.
