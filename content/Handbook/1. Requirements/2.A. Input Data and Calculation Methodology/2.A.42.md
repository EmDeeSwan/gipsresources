## Discussion
Composite time-weighted returns for private market investment composites must be calculated at least quarterly. Quarterly returns are important for investors to be able to compare performance with private market investment benchmarks, which are typically reported on a quarterly basis. Quarterly returns are also needed for comparability with other asset classes and for comparability of data in GIPS Reports.
