## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST NOT USE [[EXTERNAL VALUATION|EXTERNAL VALUATIONS]] for REAL ESTATE investments when the valuer’s or appraiser’s fee is contingent upon the investment’s appraised value.
## Discussion
The firm must not use external valuations when the valuer’s or appraiser’s fee is contingent upon the investment’s appraised value. To do so could damage the objectivity of the valuer or appraiser and lead to a higher valuation than would otherwise be the case. The linking of a valuer’s or appraiser’s fee to the investment’s appraised value will also lead to the perception that the investment’s appraised value may have an upward bias, reducing the confidence of those evaluating the investment and the resulting valuation.
