## Standard for Firms
COMPOSITE [[GROSS-OF-FEES]] returns MUST reflect the deduction of [[TRANSACTION COSTS]].
## Discussion
Transaction costs are the costs of buying or selling investments. These costs typically take the form of brokerage commissions, exchange fees and/or taxes, and/or bid-offer spreads from either internal or external brokers. Custodial fees charged per transaction should be considered custody fees, not transaction costs. For real estate, private equity, and other private market investments, transaction costs include all legal, financial, advisory, and investment banking fees related to buying, selling, restructuring, and/or recapitalizing investments but do not include dead deal costs. When calculating composite gross-of-fees returns, transaction costs must be deducted from the underlying portfolio returns.

Other fees or expenses, such as custody fees, may also be deducted. If this is the case, the firm must disclose which additional fees or costs have been deducted when calculating the gross-of-fees returns.

For additional information on deduction of transaction costs, please refer to Provision [[2.A.13]].
