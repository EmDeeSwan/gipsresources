## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM uses the last available historical price or preliminary, estimated value as [[FAIR VALUE]], the FIRM MUST:
- Consider it to be the best approximation of the current [[FAIR VALUE]].
- Assess the difference between the approximation and final value and the effect on COMPOSITE or POOLED FUND assets, TOTAL FIRM ASSETS, and performance, and also make any adjustments when the final value is received.
## Discussion
It is not uncommon for private market investments to be valued using preliminary, estimated values. If a firm uses the last available historical price or preliminary, estimated values as fair value, perhaps in order to produce a GIPS Report on a timely basis, the firm must consider the estimate of value to be the best approximation of the current fair value, and this must be defined in the firm’s fair valuation policy. When using preliminary, estimated values, the firm should obtain an understanding of the process used to establish estimated values in order to determine whether reliance can be placed on the process.

Firms must define the use of the last available historical price or preliminary, estimated values, and the treatment of subsequent final values, in their composite-specific and/or pooled fund-specific fair valuation policies. The valuation policies must be followed consistently and made available upon request. If the firm uses the last available historical price or preliminary, estimated values, when final values are received the firm must assess the difference between the estimate of value and the final value, as well as the effect on composite or pooled fund assets, total firm assets, and performance. If the final values and resulting performance differ materially, firms must determine whether any adjustments to the composite or pooled fund must be made on a prospective basis or retroactively. If composite or pooled fund valuations are revised retroactively, firms must consider the requirements related to error correction and the firm’s error correction policies. Differences between final and estimated values are not considered to be errors but are treated similarly.

It is important to remember the underlying principles of the GIPS standards: fair representation and full disclosure. If differences between the estimated and final values are consistently material, the firm should reassess whether it is proper to continue to use the estimates of fair value.
