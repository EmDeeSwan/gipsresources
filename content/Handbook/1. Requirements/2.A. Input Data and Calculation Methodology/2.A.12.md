## Standard for Firms
Returns for periods of less than one year MUST NOT be annualized.
## Discussion
Composite or pooled fund performance reflects only the performance of actual assets managed by the firm. When returns for periods of less than one year are annualized, the partial-year return is “extended” in order to create an annual return. The extrapolation of the partial-year return produces a simulated return and does not reflect the performance of actual assets. Therefore, performance for periods of less than one year must not be annualized.

Care must be taken when money-weighted returns (MWRs) are calculated and the composite or pooled fund has less than a year of performance. Many firms use Excel to calculate MWRs using the XIRR function. The XIRR function calculates an annualized internal rate of return (IRR) (an IRR is a method that can be used to calculate an MWR). When calculating an XIRR for a period of less than one year, the annualized return generated must be “de-annualized.”

The non-annualized since inception IRR (SI-IRR) can be calculated as follows:

where
- _R<sub>SI-IRR</sub> = non-annualized since-inception internal rate of return
- _r<sub>SI-IRR</sub> = annualized since-inception internal rate of return
- _TD_ = total number of calendar days in the measurement period (less than one year)

For example, a portfolio is funded with $1,000,000 cash on 1 September 2020. Another $75,000 is contributed on 10 September 2020. At the end of the month, 30 September 2020, the portfolio is valued at $1,100,000. Also assume that end-of-day cash flows are used. Using Excel’s XIRR formula the annualized SI-IRR is 34.41%.

|Dates|External Cash Flows & Ending Valuation|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|1-Sep-2020|$ (1,000,000)|Contribution|
|10-Sep-2020|$ (75,000)|Contribution|
|30-Sep-2020|$ 1,100,000|Portfolio value as of 30 September 2020|
||34.41%|Calculated annualized return using XIRR|

To calculate the non-annualized return in Excel, using the non-annualized SI-IRR formula, the calculation is as follows:
	 = (1 + 0.3441)^(29/365) – 1
	 = 2.38%
