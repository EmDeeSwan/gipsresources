# 2.A.35
## Standard for Firms
COMPOSITE TIME-WEIGHTED RETURNS except PRIVATE MARKET INVESTMENT [[COMPOSITE|COMPOSITES]] (see [[2.A.42]]) MUST be calculated at least monthly.
## Discussion
The more frequently composite returns are calculated, the more accurate the results will be. Quarterly composite calculations are permitted for periods prior to 1 January 2010; subsequently, composite returns must be calculated at least monthly. The portfolios included in the composite must be consistent for the entire performance measurement period (e.g., for the entire month if the composite is calculated using monthly portfolio returns).

Private market investment composites are excluded from this provision because they are not required to be valued monthly.
