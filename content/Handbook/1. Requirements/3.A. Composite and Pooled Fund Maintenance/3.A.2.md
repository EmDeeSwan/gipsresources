## Standard for Firms
All actual, fee-paying, discretionary SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS MUST be included in at least one [[COMPOSITE]]. Non-discretionary PORTFOLIOS MUST NOT be included in [[COMPOSITE|COMPOSITES]].
## Discussion
A segregated account is a portfolio owned by a single client. As noted in Provision [[3.A.1]], a segregated account with a pooled fund wrapper (i.e., a single-investor pooled fund), which is unitized but not available to other investors, is treated as a segregated account. In addition, a firm that is a sub-advisor for one or more pooled funds must treat the sub-advised pooled funds as segregated accounts.

An actual segregated account is a portfolio that is invested in real, tangible assets and is differentiated from a hypothetical, simulated, or backtested track record for a portfolio or an advisory-only (model) portfolio.

A fee-paying segregated account incurs investment management fees, which are fees paid to the firm, either directly or indirectly, for the management of the segregated account. If a segregated account pays no investment management fees, it is considered a non-fee-paying segregated account.

If a firm temporarily waives the investment management fee for a segregated account that is normally charged a fee, the segregated account is still considered a fee-paying segregated account (with a fee of zero for that period) and must be included in the appropriate composite. Some firms may manage segregated accounts that have a minimal investment management fee that is meant to cover operating or transaction costs. This arrangement is common for segregated accounts that are owned by friends and employees of the firm. If a segregated account has a very small investment management fee that is not representative of the investment management fee that a segregated account would typically pay, the firm must consider such a segregated account as a fee-paying account for purposes of composite inclusion. However, because the segregated account has only a minimal investment management fee that is not representative of the firm’s investment management fee for that strategy, the segregated account should be included in the percentage of composite assets that is non-fee paying. The percentage of composite assets that is non-fee paying is a required disclosure in GIPS Composite Reports when net-of-fees composite returns are presented and are calculated using actual investment management fees.

A firm is not required to include non-fee-paying segregated accounts in a composite but may choose to do so. Examples of non-fee-paying segregated accounts are portfolios consisting of the firm’s own pension plan assets or portfolios managed for friends or employees of the firm that are not charged investment management fees. If the firm chooses to include non-fee-paying discretionary segregated accounts in one or more of its composites, the firm is not required to include all non-fee-paying discretionary segregated accounts in composites. If a firm chooses to include non-fee-paying discretionary segregated accounts in a specific composite, however, all non-feepaying segregated accounts meeting the definition of that composite must be included.

If the firm includes non-fee-paying discretionary segregated accounts in its composites, they are subject to the same rules as fee-paying segregated accounts (e.g., the firm must not move non-fee-paying segregated accounts into and out of a composite unless documented changes in client guidelines or the redefinition of the composite makes it appropriate).

A discretionary segregated account is one for which the firm has the ability to implement its intended strategy. If documented client-imposed restrictions significantly hinder the firm from fully implementing its intended strategy, the firm may determine that the segregated account is non-discretionary. There are degrees of discretion, and not all client-imposed restrictions will necessarily cause a segregated account to be non-discretionary. The firm must determine if the restrictions will, or could, interfere with implementing the intended strategy to the extent that the segregated account is no longer representative of the strategy. Firms are responsible for determining whether account restrictions render a segregated account non-discretionary. Discretion may be defined at the segregated account, pooled fund, composite, asset class, or firm level. Once the definition of discretion has been determined, it must be documented in the firm’s policies and procedures and applied consistently. Firms must also document the reasons for classifying each non-discretionary segregated account as non-discretionary.

Firms should, where possible and appropriate, consider classifying segregated accounts with defined restrictions as discretionary and grouping them with any other portfolios that have similar restrictions and are managed in the same strategy in a composite.

Non-discretionary segregated accounts must not be included in a firm’s composites. Some firms, however, may group together some or all of the firm’s non-discretionary segregated accounts in order to simplify account administration. For purposes of complying with the GIPS standards, such a group is not a composite and must not be included on the firm’s list of composite descriptions.

Because the intent of the GIPS standards is to accurately and fairly represent firm performance, all actual, fee-paying, discretionary segregated accounts must be included in at least one of the firm’s composites. This requirement helps ensure that a firm presents a complete performance record. Without this requirement, firms could potentially exclude poorly performing segregated accounts from composites.

Each composite must contain all segregated accounts that meet the composite’s definition. (See Provision [[3.A.5]] for guidance on the creation of composite definitions.) Therefore, firms must include a segregated account in more than one composite if it satisfies the definition of more than one composite. If the firm includes portfolios in more than one composite, care must be taken to ensure that assets are not double counted when calculating total firm assets. A segregated account must be counted only once, even if it is included in more than one composite.

(See Provision [[2.A.3]].)

In addition to segregated accounts, firms may have created carve-outs managed with their own cash balance, or carve-outs with allocated cash. A carve-out is a portion of a portfolio that is by itself representative of a distinct investment strategy. It is used to create a track record for a narrower mandate from a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class portfolio managed to a broader mandate. If a firm has included carve-outs with their own cash balance in a composite, all carve-outs with their own cash balance that have been created and that meet the composite definition for that strategy must be included in that composite. If a firm has included carve-outs with allocated cash in a composite, it must create carve-outs from all similar portfolios within the firm, and all carve-outs with allocated cash that meet the composite definition must be included in that composite.
### Multi-Strategy or Multi-Asset-Class Portfolios
Some firms offer a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class segregated account, with each of the underlying strategies or asset classes included in the segregated account represented by “building blocks” for the strategy, which may be portfolios or carve-outs. A [[carve-out]] is a portion of a portfolio that is by itself representative of a distinct investment strategy. It may be used to create a track record for a narrower mandate from a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class portfolio managed to a broader mandate. For example, a multi-strategy fixed-income segregated account might include portfolios or carve-outs that represent different fixed-income strategies, such as long- and short-duration strategies or high-yield and high-quality strategies. A multi-asset class portfolio might include portfolios or carve-outs that represent equity and fixed-income strategies.

All actual, fee-paying discretionary segregated accounts must be included in at least one composite. This can be accomplished either by including total multi-strategy and multi-asset-class segregated accounts in composites or by including each of the underlying portfolios or carve-outs of total segregated accounts in composites. With the issuance of the 2020 edition of the GIPS standards, a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class segregated account is no longer required to be included in a composite if each of the segregated account’s underlying portfolios or carve-outs are included in appropriate composites. This guidance replaces guidance included in a Q&A issued in November 2012 stating that a discretionary multi-strategy portfolio was required to be included in a multi-strategy composite, even if all of the underlying portfolio segments were included in composites. This change applies to all periods for which the firm claims compliance.

A firm may also choose to include both multi-strategy or multi-asset-class segregated accounts and the underlying portfolio or carve-out segments in a composite. The firm may then present the multi-strategy or multi-asset-class composites or the segment composites to prospective clients, or it may choose to present both. If the firm chooses to present segment composites and not present multi-strategy or multi-asset-class composites to prospective clients of a multi-assetclass or multi-strategy composite, it must present all segment composites of the multi-strategy or multi-asset-class strategy.

When the firm chooses to maintain both multi-strategy or multi-asset-class composites and the segment composites, it must be careful not to double count when calculating total firm assets.

It is the firm’s responsibility to ensure that all of its actual, fee-paying, discretionary segregated accounts are included in any composite for which they meet the composite definition. Accordingly, firms must have policies and procedures to identify changes to a segregated account (both discretionary and non-discretionary) that would require a segregated account to be reclassified for composite assignment purposes. If a segregated account changes from discretionary to non-discretionary status because of a new restriction and must be removed from a composite, the segregated account must be removed from the composite on a prospective basis only.
