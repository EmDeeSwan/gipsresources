# 3.A.5 Definition Guiding Principles
## Discussion
### Composite Definition Guiding Principles
The following are guiding principles that firms must consider when defining composites:
- Composites should enable current and prospective clients and investors to compare the performance of one firm with that of another.
- Firms must apply the criteria for defining composites consistently. For example, the firm may not select only certain, specific portfolios that meet the composite definition (i.e., “cherry-picking”) but must include all portfolios that satisfy the criteria for inclusion.
- Firms are not permitted to include portfolios with materially dissimilar investment mandates, objectives, or strategies in the same composite. The performance of such a composite is meaningless. When there are many portfolios that have unique, defining investment characteristics and these portfolios have a strategy that is managed for or offered as a segregated account, it may be necessary for the firm to create numerous single-portfolio composites.
- Portfolios must not be moved from one composite to another unless documented changes to a portfolio’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy or the redefinition of the composite makes such a move appropriate. The historical performance of the portfolio must remain with the original composite.

The firm may create broader composites, sometimes referred to as “umbrella” or “parent” composites, that include portfolios from more narrowly defined composites. For example, a firm may create a composite of all fixed-income portfolios with an intermediate-maturity mandate that includes portfolios from different intermediate-maturity-term composites that are based on specific benchmarks. Please see Provision [[3.A.19]] for additional guidance on this point.
