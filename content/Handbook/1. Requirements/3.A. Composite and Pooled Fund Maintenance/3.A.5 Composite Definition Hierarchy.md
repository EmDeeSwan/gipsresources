# 3.A.5 Composite Definition Hierarchy
## Discussion
The following suggested hierarchy may be helpful as firms consider how to define composites. Firms are not required to define their composites according to each level of the hierarchy. When considering this suggested hierarchy for composite definition, it is important to keep in mind that pooled funds are required to be included in a composite if they meet a composite definition.
### General Considerations
#### Investment Mandate, Objective, or Strategy
Composites may be based on the overall investment mandate, objective or strategy, or overall product description.
- Examples: Large-cap global equities, long-maturity international bonds, small-cap stocks, global long/short equity, or private equity
#### Asset Class
Composites based on a broad asset class are the most basic and should be representative of the firm’s products. Firms may further define asset classes by country or region.
- Examples: Equity, fixed income, balanced, real estate, venture capital, US fixed income, European equities
#### Style or Sector
Firms may further define a composite based on the style or sector.
- Examples: Growth, value, active, indexed, asset class sector (e.g., telecommunications)
#### Benchmark
Firms may define composites based on the portfolios’ benchmark, provided the benchmark reflects the investment mandate, objective, or strategy. This situation is often the case if the benchmark also defines the investment universe.
- Examples: Swiss Performance Index, S&P 500 Index, FTSE 100 Index
#### Risk/Return Characteristics
Portfolios with different risk characteristics (e.g., targeted tracking error, beta, volatility, and information ratio) and return objectives may be grouped together into different composites.
- Example: A Japanese equity portfolio with a targeted excess return of 1% and targeted tracking error of 2% would be in a separate composite from a Japanese equity portfolio with a targeted excess return of 3% and targeted tracking error of 6%.
### Constraints/Guidelines
Firms may choose to further define their composites based on relevant client constraints or guidelines. The following are examples of constraints or guidelines that could result in materially different strategies and, therefore, justify separate composites.
#### Extent of the Use of Derivatives, Hedging, Short Positions, and/or Leverage
Portfolios that use derivatives, hedging, short positions, and/or leverage may have a different investment strategy from those portfolios that do not use these techniques or instruments. Accordingly, firms must consider whether portfolios that use derivatives, hedging, short positions, and/or leverage should be included in separate composites from portfolios that are restricted from using, or do not use, such instruments or strategies.
#### Tax Considerations
The firm should define separate composites for portfolios with specific tax considerations if such considerations hinder the firm’s ability to implement a specific investment strategy as compared with similar portfolios without specific tax considerations. The different tax situations of institutional and private clients may require different investment strategies. For example, private clients may have restrictions against selling an investment at a loss and rebuying the same investment within a specific time period, but institutional portfolios typically do not have such restrictions. If tax considerations result in different strategies based on the portfolio’s tax status, firms are required to define separate composites appropriate to the different strategies.
#### Type of Client (e.g., pension fund, private client, endowment)
Client type alone must not be used as the primary criterion for defining a composite. In some cases, however, the client type determines the investment strategy because of characteristics that are unique to the client type. If portfolios of different client types have materially different investment strategies and/or styles that are specific to the type of client, the firm must create separate composites representing each of the different strategies that is managed for or offered as a segregated account.

One example would be a wrap fee client. Wrap fee portfolios involve a bundled fee that is specific to the particular investment product. Although the firm can use the same investment strategy for both wrap fee and non-wrap fee portfolios, it may not always have a direct relationship with the end user of its investment management services, even though these portfolios are often considered discretionary assets of the firm. Instead, multiple parties are involved in this business model, with a wrap fee sponsor serving as the intermediary between the firm and the end user of investment services. These factors are what distinguishes wrap fee portfolios and necessitates additional guidance for creating composites. For information on creating appropriate composites to show to prospective wrap fee clients, both before and after a firm obtains wrap fee portfolios, please see Provision [[3.A.14]].
#### Instruments Used
The firm may define separate composites based on the specific instruments used for a strategy. An example would be portfolios managed in a commodity strategy, wherein some portfolios choose to invest in the commodity strategy using futures while other portfolios invest in the commodity strategy using physical commodities.
#### Portfolio Size
Differences in portfolio size may result in meaningful, material differences in investment strategy and justify the creation of separate composites. For example, smaller segregated accounts managed according to a mid-cap equity strategy may be invested in pooled funds while larger segregated accounts managed in the same strategy are invested in individual securities.
#### Client Characteristics (e.g., cash flow needs, risk tolerances)
Firms may create composites based on multiple client characteristics. For example, a firm may choose to create a growth equity composite for clients that require a 15% cash balance because they withdraw cash on a regular basis versus clients whose portfolios are fully invested. Cash flow considerations and how they affect the investment strategy are often key factors when firms consider whether to include pooled funds in composites.
#### Portfolio Types/Legal Structure
A composite must include all portfolios that are managed according to the same strategy. Differences in portfolio types or legal structure alone would not warrant a separate composite definition. If differences in portfolio types, such as limited partnerships and segregated accounts, lead to differences in how the strategy is implemented, then the firm would split limited partnerships and segregated accounts into separate composites. Differences driven by a portfolio’s legal structure may also arise in implementing a strategy. For example, some portfolio types may be prohibited from investing in 144(a) securities or new-issue IPOs. If the portfolio type or legal structure does not affect the management of the portfolio, then portfolio type or legal structure must not be used as a criterion for composite definition. If the portfolio type or legal structure affects the management of the portfolio, then the firm must create separate composites based on portfolio type or legal structure.

Prior to 1 January 2020, firms were allowed to differentiate between segregated accounts and pooled funds when defining composites. For example, a firm could choose to create one composite for segregated accounts managed in the firm’s large-cap equity strategy and another composite for pooled funds managed in the same strategy. As of 1 January 2020, firms may no longer take this approach. On a prospective basis, pooled funds managed in a strategy that is managed for or offered as a segregated account must be included in the same composite as any segregated accounts managed or offered in that strategy.
#### Currencies
Reporting currency must not be used as a criterion for composite definition unless it affects the investment strategy. For example, suppose that a firm manages portfolios invested in a S&P 500 Index strategy. Some investors in this strategy require reporting in Swiss francs (CHF), some require reporting in British pounds (GBP), and others require reporting in US dollars (USD). If the difference in reporting currencies does not create a difference in the underlying portfolios, the firm may not create different composites based on the client reporting currencies.

In contrast, differences in portfolio base currencies that have a material effect on strategy implementation must be considered when defining composites. For example, if a client instructs the firm to invest cash balances in a different currency, this cash restriction could be used as a criterion for composite definition. Additionally, if currency hedging is part of the investment strategy, different composites may be required. Although the hedged returns of portfolios denominated in different currencies are intended to be similar if they are managed to the same strategy, there will be a difference in returns (even with perfect hedging) equivalent to the cost (or benefit) of hedging. This cost (or benefit) of hedging caused by the interest rate differential between currencies can be significant over time.
### Additional Considerations
#### Multi-Strategy or Multi-Asset-Class Portfolios
Some firms offer a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class segregated account, with each of the underlying strategies or asset classes included in the segregated account represented by “building blocks” for the strategy, which may be portfolios or carve-outs. A carve-out is a portion of a portfolio that is by itself representative of a distinct investment strategy. It may be used to create a track record for a narrower mandate from a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class portfolio managed to a broader mandate. For example, a multi-strategy fixed-income segregated account might include portfolios or carve-outs that represent different fixed-income strategies, such as long- and short-duration strategies or high-yield and high-quality strategies. A multi-asset-class portfolio might include portfolios or carve-outs that represent equity and fixed-income strategies.

All actual, fee-paying discretionary segregated accounts must be included in at least one composite. This can be accomplished either by including total multi-strategy and multi-asset-class segregated accounts in composites or by including each of the underlying portfolios or carve-outs of total segregated accounts in composites. With the issuance of the 2020 edition of the GIPS standards, a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class segregated account is no longer required to be included in a composite if each of the segregated account’s underlying portfolios or carve-outs are included in appropriate composites. This guidance replaces guidance included in a Q&A issued in November 2012 stating that a discretionary multi-strategy portfolio was required to be included in a multi-strategy composite, even if all of the underlying portfolio segments were included in composites. This change applies to all periods for which the firm claims compliance.

A firm may also choose to include both multi-strategy or multi-asset-class segregated accounts and the underlying portfolio or carve-out segments in a composite. The firm may then present the multi-strategy or multi-asset-class composites or the segment composites to prospective clients, or it may choose to present both. If the firm chooses to present segment composites and not present multi-strategy or multi-asset-class composites to prospective clients of a multi-assetclass or multi-strategy composite, it must present all segment composites of the multi-strategy or multi-asset-class strategy.

When the firm chooses to maintain both multi-strategy or multi-asset-class composites and segment composites, it must be careful not to double count when calculating total firm assets.
- Example 1:
	- A firm creates balanced portfolios with different weights for equity and fixed income based on a client’s investment needs. The firm may determine that each segregated account is so customized that the composites for total segregated accounts would not be meaningful. The firm decides to include the segments of each segregated account in asset class composites and does not create balanced composites.
- Example 2:
	- A firm might decide to create composites based on ranges that represent various blends of a balanced strategy with an equity component and a fixed-income component. There might be an “aggressive” balanced composite for portfolios whose equity segment represents 70% to 100% of the balanced portfolio, a “moderate” balanced composite for portfolios whose equity portion represents 40% to 69%, and a “conservative” composite for portfolios whose equity segment represents 0% to 39%. The firm may also choose to create both balanced and asset class composites.

It is important to remember that if a firm chooses to include a total multi-strategy or multi-assetclass portfolio in a composite, the composite must be constructed according to strategic ranges of asset mixes provided in the client investment guidelines, not according to the tactical percentage of assets invested in the different asset classes. Firms often have discretion to tactically alter the asset allocation in an effort to add value. Portfolios must not be moved into or out of composites in response to changes in tactical asset allocation. Only in the case of client-documented strategic asset allocation changes can portfolios be moved into different composites. Client-documented strategic asset allocation changes include those situations in which the client has given contractual authority to the portfolio manager to make strategic changes in asset allocation. Please see Provision [[3.A.10]] for additional guidance on this point.
#### Inception Date
Because composites represent an investment strategy over time, a composite based solely on the composite’s inception date would, generally, not show representative results of how the strategy performed over time in changing market conditions. Therefore, in general, firms are not permitted to create composites based solely on the composite inception date.

In very specific situations, however, such as for private equity or real estate closed-end fund composites, it may be appropriate to group portfolios into composites according to inception date (i.e., by vintage year) and strategy. Vintage year is typically based on either the year of the investment vehicle’s first drawdown or capital call from its investors or the year when the first committed capital from outside investors is closed and legally binding. For certain investments, the vintage year will drive the investment opportunities in a certain strategy.
#### Firms with Multiple Offices, Branches, or Investment Divisions
Firms are permitted to define different composites for offices, branches, or investment divisions within the defined firm only if the portfolios are managed according to investment mandates, objectives, or strategies that are unique to each particular office, branch, or division. Thus, it is the investment mandate, objective, or strategy that determines the composite, not the location or group. Composites may, therefore, include portfolios from different offices within the firm that are managed according to the same investment mandate, objective, or strategy. However, composites must include only portfolios within the definition of the firm.
#### Internal Dispersion of Portfolio Returns within a Composite
Although internal dispersion is one measure to determine how consistently a firm has implemented its strategy across the portfolios in the composite, it can be measured only on an ex post basis and, therefore, must not be used as a criterion to define a composite. An internal dispersion figure may serve as a good indicator of whether the criteria for composite definition are suitable or whether the firm should consider redefining the composite. There is no general rule for a maximum amount of composite internal dispersion. The firm should contemplate the definition of a broad, “inclusive” composite with a wide internal dispersion of portfolio returns versus a narrow, “exclusive” composite with a narrower internal dispersion measure.
#### Treatment of Fees
Firms must not define a composite based on either the type of fees that are paid or the portfolios’ fee schedule. For example, it would not be appropriate to create two versions of a composite that differ only because some portfolios in the composite have a performance-based investment management fee while others do not. A firm may not exclude a pooled fund from a composite for which the fund meets the composite definition solely because the fund pays higher fees than segregated accounts.

Firms should include non-fee-paying portfolios in composites. The GIPS standards do not, however, require that non-fee-paying portfolios be included in composites.

#### Portfolio Manager
Composites must not be defined solely based on portfolio manager. For example, if a firm uses five portfolio managers to manage portfolios invested in its Growth Equity strategy, and all portfolio managers follow the same investment strategy, the firm must not create composites based on individual portfolio managers. Composites must be defined by the strategy according to which portfolios are managed and not by the person who manages the portfolios.
#### Inclusion of Segregated Accounts and Pooled Funds in Composites
Once a firm has established composite definitions, all actual, fee-paying, discretionary segregated accounts must be assigned to at least one appropriate composite, as well as to all composites for which they meet the composite definition. All actual, fee-paying discretionary pooled funds must be assigned to any composite for which they meet a composite definition. If a segregated account or pooled fund meets more than one composite definition, the segregated account or pooled fund must be included in each of the relevant composites
