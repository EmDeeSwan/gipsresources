# 3.A.10
## Standard for Firms
PORTFOLIOS MUST NOT be moved from one COMPOSITE to another unless documented client-directed changes to a PORTFOLIO’S investment mandate, objective, or strategy or the redefinition of the COMPOSITE make it appropriate. The historical performance of the PORTFOLIO MUST remain with the original [[COMPOSITE]]. PORTFOLIOS MUST NOT be moved into or out of [[COMPOSITE|COMPOSITES]] as a result of the FIRM’S tactical changes.
## Discussion
Firms are permitted to move portfolios (segregated accounts and pooled funds) into and out of composites only because of documented changes to a portfolio’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy or in the case where the redefinition of a composite makes it appropriate. Documentation of the client-directed change can include, but is not limited to, letters, e-mails, and internal memorandums documenting conversations with clients.

This requirement seeks to preclude or at least minimize the movement of portfolios into, out of, and between composites. Theoretically, once a firm creates composites based on its various investment strategies, portfolios will be managed to those strategies on a long-term basis. As a result, defining composites is a critical issue when complying with the GIPS standards.

Over time, however, a client’s investment objective may change, a pooled fund’s investment mandate may be modified, and firms may adopt new investment strategies. In those instances, moving a portfolio from one composite to another may be necessary. In the case of segregated accounts, wherein the client selects the strategy, the move must be based on a change in the segregated account’s strategy that is directed by the client and is clearly identified and documented. In the case of a pooled fund, there must be a documented change in the pooled fund’s investment strategy. Portfolios must not be moved from one composite to another because of changes in tactical asset allocation. Portfolios can be moved into different composites only in the case of client-documented strategic asset allocation changes for segregated accounts or changes in the investment mandate for pooled funds, or when the redefinition of a composite makes such a move appropriate.

If the firm suggests a change in strategy that would result in a client’s portfolio moving to a new composite, the firm must make every reasonable effort to provide the client with a GIPS Composite Report for the new composite. If the client requests a change that would result in the firm moving the client’s portfolio to a new composite, the firm should provide the client with a GIPS Composite Report for the new composite but is not required to do so.

There are situations in which a client has contractually given the firm authority over the allocation of a multi-strategy or multi-asset-class portfolio. In such cases, the documentation of an allocation change should be considered “client-directed” documentation for the change when combined with a client contract that assigns the firm authority over asset allocation within a portfolio.  
The documentation of the change must include the timing of and reason for the change and must be recorded. A memo to the client file or a record in the client management system would suffice.

The transfer of a portfolio from one composite to another is treated like a portfolio termination when it is removed from the former composite and treated like a new portfolio when moved to the new composite. The portfolio’s prior history must remain in the former composite through the last full measurement period during which the portfolio was managed in the former style.
