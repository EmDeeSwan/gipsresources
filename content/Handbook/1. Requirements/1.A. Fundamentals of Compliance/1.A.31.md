## Standard for Firms
When the FIRM jointly markets with other firms, the FIRM claiming compliance with the GIPS standards MUST ensure that the FIRM is clearly defined and separate relative to other firms being marketed and also that it is clear which FIRM is claiming compliance.
## Discussion
A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards may jointly market with another firm that may or may not comply with the GIPS standards. To avoid confusion when jointly marketing with another firm, a GIPS-compliant firm must be sure that it is clearly defined relative to the other firm with which it is jointly marketing, and it must be clear as to which firm is, or which firms are, claiming compliance with the GIPS standards. The clarity regarding which firm is, or which firms are, claiming compliance with the GIPS standards is necessary for the firm’s joint marketing activities to meet the criterion of fair representation, a fundamental principle of the GIPS standards.
