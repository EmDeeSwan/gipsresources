## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST NOT make statements referring to the performance of a current client or [[POOLED FUND]] investor as being “calculated in accordance with the Global Investment Performance Standards,” except for when a GIPS-compliant FIRM reports the performance of a [[SEGREGATED ACCOUNT]] to current clients or a [[POOLED FUND]] to current investors.

## Discussion
The GIPS standards do not specifically address how a firm must report performance of an individual client’s portfolio to current clients or how the performance of an investor’s investment in a pooled fund must be reported to current pooled fund investors. The GIPS standards do provide an ethical framework for calculating and presenting a firm’s investment performance history, allowing both prospective and current clients and pooled fund investors the best opportunity to fairly evaluate the firm’s past performance.

The firm must not make statements referring to the performance of a current client or pooled fund investor as being “calculated in accordance with the Global Investment Performance Standards,” except for when a GIPS-compliant firm reports the performance of a segregated account to current clients or a pooled fund to current investors. When a firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards reports the performance of a current client’s portfolio to that client or reports the performance of an investor’s investment in a pooled fund to a current pooled fund investor, the firm may note on the current client’s or investor’s performance report that the return was calculated in accordance with the requirements of the GIPS standards if the statement is true.
