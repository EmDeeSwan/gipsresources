## Standard for Firms
Once the FIRM has provided a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] to a PROSPECTIVE CLIENT, the FIRM MUST provide an updated [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] at least once every 12 months if the PROSPECTIVE CLIENT is still a PROSPECTIVE CLIENT.
## Discussion
Some prospective clients remain prospective clients for extended periods. Once a firm has provided a GIPS Composite Report to a prospective client, the firm must provide an updated GIPS Composite Report at least once every 12 months if the prospective client is still a prospective client. If a firm provides performance information to an investment consultant or a database, these entities qualify as prospective clients and must receive the appropriate GIPS Composite Report(s). They must also receive an updated GIPS Composite Report at least once every 12 months.
