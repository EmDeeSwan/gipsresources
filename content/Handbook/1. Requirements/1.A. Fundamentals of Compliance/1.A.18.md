## Standard for Firms
A [[COMPOSITE]] [[BENCHMARK]] used in a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] must reflect the investment mandate, objective, or strategy of the composite. The FIRM MUST NOT use a price-only [[BENCHMARK]] in a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]].
## Discussion
Benchmarks are important tools that aid in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of a portfolio’s investment policy. They also help facilitate discussions with prospective clients regarding the relationship between risk and return. As a result, firms are required to present the total return for a benchmark that reflects the composite’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy in all GIPS Composite Reports.

GIPS Composite Reports that include time-weighted returns must include composite returns for each annual period. GIPS Composite Reports that include money-weighted returns must include the composite return for the period from inception through the most recent annual period end. Firms must present benchmark returns for these required periods and for any additional periods for which composite returns are presented. For example, if a GIPS Composite Report includes quarterly composite returns, quarterly benchmark returns must also be included.

The benchmark that appears in a GIPS Composite Report may be different from the benchmark(s) used for the portfolios that are included in the composite. For example, a firm may decide that it is appropriate to include portfolios with different benchmarks in the same composite. Additionally, a firm may present more than one benchmark in a GIPS Composite Report. The firm must determine the appropriate benchmark or benchmarks for each composite.

There may be situations in which there is no appropriate benchmark for a composite – that is, no benchmark exists that reflects the composite’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy. In such cases, the firm must not present a benchmark in the GIPS Composite Report and must disclose why no benchmark is presented. Outside of a GIPS Composite Report, a firm may present a benchmark that is not reflective of the composite’s strategy. There must, however, be a valid reason for doing so. For example, if a firm believes that no appropriate benchmark exists, it might want to present a market index to represent the opportunity cost of investing in the composite’s investment strategy. If such a benchmark is used outside of a GIPS Composite Report, there must be sufficient disclosure so that a prospective client or prospective investor understands the nature of the benchmark and why it is being presented. Disclosure, however, does not necessarily prevent information from being false or misleading. A firm must not select a benchmark for the purpose of providing a favorable comparison to the performance of the composite. To do so would be misleading, regardless of the disclosures accompanying the benchmark.

Because the GIPS standards require that the total return for the benchmark be presented, a price-only index will not satisfy the requirements of the GIPS standards. This also applies to benchmarks that are components of a blended benchmark. A blended benchmark is the combination of two or more indexes, such as a benchmark that consists of 50% of the ABC Index and 50% of the DEF Index. In this example, both the ABC Index and the DEF Index must be total return benchmarks, not price-only benchmarks. However, when there is an appropriate total return benchmark, a price-only benchmark may be presented in a GIPS Composite Report as supplemental information, as well as outside of a GIPS Composite Report if the price-only benchmark is accompanied by a total return benchmark. If a price-only benchmark is included in a GIPS Composite Report as supplemental information, or is presented outside of a GIPS Composite Report, it must be identified as a price-only benchmark, and there must be sufficient disclosures so that a prospective client or prospective investor understands the difference between the return of a price-only benchmark and the return of a total return benchmark. If no appropriate total return benchmark for the composite’s strategy exists, the firm may not present a price-only benchmark in a GIPS Composite Report but may present it outside of a GIPS Composite Report. In such cases, “price only” must be included in the label or the name of the benchmark. As in all cases where a price-only benchmark is presented, there must be sufficient disclosures so that a prospective client or prospective investor understands the difference between the return of a price-only benchmark and the return of a total return benchmark.

Some benchmarks may appear to be price-only benchmarks because they do not include income, but they should be considered total return benchmarks. These include the following:
- private market equivalent (PME) benchmarks,
- commodity benchmarks, and similar benchmarks, that do not have income because of the nature of the benchmark constituents, and
- target returns, such as an 8% hurdle rate.
