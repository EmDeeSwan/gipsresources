# 1.A.1
## Standard for Firms
The GIPS standards MUST be applied on a FIRM-wide basis. Compliance MUST be met on a FIRM-wide basis and cannot be met on a [[COMPOSITE]], [[POOLED FUND]], or [[PORTFOLIO]] basis.
## Discussion
The GIPS standards provide an ethical framework for calculating and presenting a firmâ€™s investment performance history. The [[1.A.2|definition of the firm]] is the foundation for firm-wide compliance and creates defined boundaries for determining total firm assets. Only firms that manage actual assets may claim compliance with the GIPS standards.

To claim compliance, a firm must comply with all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards. Compliance cannot be met on a [[COMPOSITE]], [[POOLED FUND]], or [[PORTFOLIO]] basis and can be met only on a FIRM-wide basis. For example, if a firm definition includes both equity and fixed income products, the firm cannot present only its equity products (strategies) as being in compliance with the GIPS standards. If a [[1.A.2|firm definition|]] includes both [[SEGREGATED ACCOUNT|SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS]] and [[POOLED FUND|POOLED FUNDS]], the firm must meet the GIPS standards requirements for both segregated accounts and pooled funds in order to claim compliance with the GIPS standards.
