## Standard for Firms
Changes in the FIRM’S organization MUST NOT lead to alteration of historical performance.
## Discussion
Over time, the organization of a firm may change. For example, a firm may transition from a private to a public corporation or a management buyout may result in a publicly traded company becoming a private entity. Regardless of the reason for the change in a firm’s organization, historical composite or pooled fund performance must remain part of the firm’s history. In considering issues regarding the use of historical performance, it is important to remember that performance is the record of the firm, not of the individual. For example, suppose that a sole investment decision maker for a composite or pooled fund leaves a firm and the new portfolio manager continues to manage the composite or pooled fund according to the same investment mandate or strategy as the previous portfolio manager. The firm must link the historical performance of the composite or pooled fund to the ongoing performance achieved by the new portfolio manager.
