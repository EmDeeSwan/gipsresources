## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST be able to demonstrate how it made every reasonable effort to provide:
- A [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] to those PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS REQUIRED to receive a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]].
- A [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]] or [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] to those [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS REQUIRED to receive a [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]] or [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]].
## Discussion
Firms are required to make every reasonable effort to provide a GIPS Composite Report to all prospective clients and a GIPS Pooled Fund Report or GIPS Composite Report to all limited distribution pooled fund (LDPF) prospective investors. A firm may provide a GIPS Composite

Report to an LDPF prospective investor in lieu of a GIPS Pooled Fund Report only if the respective LDPF is included in the composite. Firms are also required to have policies and procedures in place that are used to establish and maintain compliance with the requirements of the GIPS standards. Therefore, any firm claiming compliance with the GIPS standards must have specific policies and procedures to ensure that every reasonable effort is made to provide the required GIPS Composite Report to prospective clients and the required GIPS Report to LDPF prospective investors. These should include policies and procedures for tracking which GIPS Reports were provided to which prospective clients or prospective investors, and when. For example, a firmâ€™s policies and procedures might specify that the required GIPS Report will be included as part of the standard package of marketing materials prepared for prospective clients or pooled fund prospective investors, and that a checklist will be used to indicate the dates on which the GIPS Report was provided to the prospective client or prospective investor and which version of the GIPS Report was provided. Documenting the date on which the GIPS Report was last provided to the prospective client or prospective investor as well as the version of the GIPS Report will help a firm fulfill the requirement that the appropriate GIPS Report be provided to a prospective client or prospective investor who remains a prospect at least once every 12 months. The most effective policies and procedures for a firm will depend on the circumstances surrounding the typical interactions between the firm and its prospective clients or prospective investors.

To demonstrate that the firm made a reasonable effort to provide the appropriate GIPS Report to prospective clients and prospective investors, it is necessary for the firm to document both the relevant policies and procedures for providing the required reports to prospective clients and pooled fund investors and the steps taken to implement the relevant policies and procedures.
