# 1.A.37
## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM chooses to include a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] or [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]] in marketing materials, the FIRM MUST indicate this fact in the marketing materials.
## Discussion
Provisions [[1.A.11]] and [[1.A.13]] require firms to make every reasonable effort to provide a GIPS Report to prospective clients and pooled fund prospective investors. If a GIPS Report is included in marketing materials, there must be a disclosure that will inform prospective clients or prospective investors that a GIPS Report is included in the marketing materials. The disclosure should be prominent (e.g., included in the table of contents) and is intended to help prospective clients and prospective investors locate the GIPS Report within the marketing materials. Such a disclosure will help to highlight the importance of the GIPS Report.
