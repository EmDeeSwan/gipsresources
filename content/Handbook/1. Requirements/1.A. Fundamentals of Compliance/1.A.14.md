## Standard for Firms
Once the FIRM has provided a [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]] or [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] to a [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR, the FIRM MUST provide an updated [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]] or [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] at least once every 12 months if the [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR is still a [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR.
## Discussion
Some limited distribution pooled fund (LDPF) prospective investors remain pooled fund prospective investors for extended periods of time. Once a firm has provided a GIPS Report, either a GIPS Pooled Fund Report or a GIPS Composite Report, to an LDPF prospective investor, the firm must provide an updated GIPS Report at least once every 12 months if the pooled fund prospective investor is still a prospective investor. If a firm provides performance information to an investment consultant or a database, these entities qualify as prospective investors and must receive the appropriate GIPS Report. They must also receive an updated GIPS Report at least once every 12 months.
