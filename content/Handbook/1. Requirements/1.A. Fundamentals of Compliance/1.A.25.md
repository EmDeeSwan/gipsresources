## Standard for Firms
All data and information necessary to support all items included in [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT|GIPS COMPOSITE REPORTS]], [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT|GIPS POOLED FUND REPORTS]], and [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT|GIPS ADVERTISEMENTS]] MUST be captured, maintained, and available within a reasonable time frame, for all periods presented in these reports and advertisements.
## Discussion
A fundamental principle of the GIPS standards is the need for firms to be able to ensure the validity of their claim of compliance. It is, therefore, important for current and prospective clients and investors, verifiers, and regulators to have confidence that all items included in a GIPS Report or GIPS Advertisement are supported by the appropriate records. This provision applies to GIPS Composite Reports for all composites and to GIPS Pooled Fund Reports for all pooled funds, whether the composite or pooled fund is marketed or not.

Firms must maintain records to be able to recalculate their performance history as well as substantiate all other information, including supplemental information, included in a GIPS Report or GIPS Advertisement, for all periods shown. This requirement applies to all time periods for which performance is presented in the GIPS Report or GIPS Advertisement. This requirement is consistent with the regulatory requirements of many countries. In some jurisdictions, however, regulators require records to be kept for longer periods than those required by the GIPS standards. Care should be taken to ensure that the firm follows the strictest of the recordkeeping requirements applicable to the firm.

It is understood that the required data may not be immediately available. For example, data may need to be retrieved from an offsite location or from a third-party service provider. However, the data and information required to be maintained by this provision must be available in a usable format within a reasonable time frame. In all instances, either paper (hard-copy) records or electronically stored records will suffice. If records are stored electronically, the records must be accessible and able to be printed or downloaded, if needed. Records stored in a system that is not operable and from which data cannot be retrieved will not satisfy the recordkeeping requirements.

Although most firms are looking for a very precise list of the minimum documents that must be maintained to support all parts of the GIPS Report or GIPS Advertisement, including the ability to recalculate the firm’s performance history, there is no single list of records that will suffice in all situations. Each firm must determine for itself which records must be maintained. The following lists include records that firms should consider maintaining to meet the recordkeeping requirements of this provision. None of these lists should be considered exhaustive. The actual records required will depend on the firm’s particular circumstances.

It is expected that all firms will have disaster recovery plans to mitigate the loss of records for any reason, whether it is a catastrophic event beyond the control of the firm or a situation within the control of the firm. If a firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards experiences a catastrophic event that destroys all of its records and electronic or other backup systems, the firm should try to reconstruct the necessary information by obtaining the information from clients, custodians, consultants, verifiers, or any other party outside the firm that might have duplicate copies of those records. If the underlying data to support the GIPS Report was destroyed because of extreme circumstances beyond the firm’s control and is unavailable from other sources, however, the firm may continue to claim compliance and show performance if the lack of records for the unavailable period(s) is disclosed.

For example, assume Firm A claims compliance with the GIPS standards, and the records for Firm A from its inception on 1 January 2017 through 31 December 2017 were destroyed under extreme circumstances beyond the firm’s control. The firm can claim compliance with the GIPS standards but must disclose that the firm’s records for the period from 1 January 2017 through 31 December 2017 were destroyed under extreme circumstances beyond the firm’s control and the data are unavailable from other sources. The firm must also consider any applicable regulatory requirements and must remember that the GIPS standards are ethical standards based on the principles of fair representation and full disclosure. Any performance information that is presented must adhere to these principles.

Firms that have not yet claimed compliance with the GIPS standards and want to do so but do not have records to support the recordkeeping requirements because they experienced a catastrophic event in the past cannot take advantage of this exception from the recordkeeping requirement. They cannot claim compliance until they have complied with all the requirements of the GIPS standards, including the requirement to have the records to support at least a five-year performance track record.

All firms are reminded that, above all else, they must follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance, including all recordkeeping requirements.
