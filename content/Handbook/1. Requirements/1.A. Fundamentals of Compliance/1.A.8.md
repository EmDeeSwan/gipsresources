# 1.A.8
## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM does not meet all the applicable REQUIREMENTS of the GIPS standards, the FIRM MUST NOT represent or state that it is “in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards except for…” or make any other statements that may indicate compliance or partial compliance with the GIPS standards.
## Discussion
When a firm makes the claim of compliance with the GIPS standards, it is representing that all of the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards have been met on a firm-wide basis. Either a firm meets all of the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards and may claim compliance, or a firm does not meet all of the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards and must not claim compliance or partial compliance with the GIPS standards. If the firm does not meet all of the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards, the firm must not represent or state that it is “in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards except for…” or make any other statements that may indicate compliance or partial compliance with the GIPS standards.
