# 8.G.6
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present BENCHMARK TOTAL RETURNS for the same periods for which the [[POOLED FUND]] is presented, unless the FIRM determines there is no appropriate BENCHMARK.
## Discussion
As described in Provisions [[8.G.1]] and [[8.G.2]], firms that present performance in a GIPS Advertisement for a broad distribution pooled fund have various options for the periods used in presenting returns. Once an option is selected, the firm must present benchmark total returns for the same periods for which pooled fund returns are presented. The benchmark must be in the same currency as the pooled fund returns presented in the GIPS Advertisement. This requirement is an acknowledgement that a comparison of benchmark and pooled fund returns will help the reader of the GIPS Advertisement determine how well the pooled fund has performed relative to the benchmark.
