___
# 8.G.5
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST clearly label [[POOLED FUND]] returns as gross or net of [[TOTAL POOLED FUND FEES]].
## Discussion
Firms may present pooled fund returns as either gross or net of total pooled fund fees in a GIPS Advertisement and may also choose to present returns both gross and net of total pooled fund fees. For readers of the GIPS Advertisement to understand the nature of the returns being presented, all returns presented must be clearly labeled as gross of total pooled fund fees or net of total pooled fund fees.

Firms advertising performance results must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, including those governing advertisements. In some jurisdictions, laws or regulations require performance in a pooled fund advertisement to be presented net of total pooled fund fees. Whether or not laws or regulations specify which returns must be presented in an advertisement, firms must clearly indicate whether returns are presented gross or net of total pooled fund fees so that the reader of the advertisement has a clear understanding of the returns that are presented.
