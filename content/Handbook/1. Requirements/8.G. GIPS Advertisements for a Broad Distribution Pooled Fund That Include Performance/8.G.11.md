___
# 8.G.11
## Standard for Firms
If laws or regulations do not mandate specific information about the [[POOLED FUND|POOLED FUND’S]] risk, the FIRM MUST choose and present an appropriate risk measure or qualitative disclosure that a PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR is likely to understand.
## Discussion
Understanding and interpreting investment performance requires the consideration of both risk and return. An indication of risk is, therefore, required in all GIPS Advertisements for broad distribution pooled funds (BDPFs). If local laws or regulations do not mandate that specific information about a pooled fund’s risk be included in an advertisement for a BDPF (see Provision [[8.G.10]]), firms must choose and present an appropriate risk measure or a qualitative narrative disclosure of risk. Firms should choose a risk measure that is well known or that can be clearly presented and explained in the GIPS Advertisement so that a broad audience is likely to understand the degree of risk that the risk indicator is intended to convey.

It is important to keep in mind that risk measures should be consistent with the pooled fund’s strategy. For example, if the strategy is to track the benchmark, then tracking error would be consistent with that objective.
