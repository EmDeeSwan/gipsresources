___
# 8.G.10
## Standard for Firms
If laws or regulations mandate specific information about the [[POOLED FUND|POOLED FUND’S]] risk, as either a qualitative narrative or a quantitative metric, the FIRM MUST disclose this information.
## Discussion
If laws or regulations mandate firms to include in an advertisement specific information about the pooled fund’s risk, as either a qualitative narrative or a quantitative metric, the firm must disclose this information. This requirement applies only to the information mandated by the applicable laws or regulations to be included in an advertisement, not to other documents of the pooled fund. For example, local laws and regulations may require that funds present specific risk indicators in prospectuses, regulatory factsheets, or investor documents but not in advertisements. In this case, such risk indicators are not required to be presented in GIPS Advertisements.

When laws and regulations conflict with the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, firms are required to comply with the laws and regulations and disclose the manner in which the laws or regulations conflict with the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.
