___
# 8.G.1
## Standard for Firms
If laws or regulations mandate specific [[POOLED FUND]] returns, the FIRM MUST present [[POOLED FUND]] returns according to the methodology and for the periods [[REQUIRE (REQUIREMENT)|REQUIRED]] by laws or regulations.
## Discussion
Laws or regulations typically specify how broad distribution pooled fund (BDPF) returns must be presented in an advertisement. If laws or regulations mandate a specific methodology for calculating BDPF returns, and specific time periods for which BDPF returns must be presented in an advertisement, a firm must follow the laws or regulations. If laws or regulations do not mandate a specific methodology and/or periodicity, the firm must instead follow the requirements in Provision [[8.G.2]].

Provisions 8.G.1 and [[8.G.2]] address only the methodology and time periods required for the presentation of returns in a GIPS Advertisement for a BDPF. Firms must comply with all of the other applicable requirements of laws or regulations and the GIPS Advertising Guidelines as well.
