## Standard for Firms
If the [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] is created for a specific [[POOLED FUND]] share class, and [[POOLED FUND NET RETURN|POOLED FUND NET RETURNS]] are presented, [[POOLED FUND NET RETURN|POOLED FUND NET RETURNS]] MUST reflect the fees and expenses of that specific share class.
## Discussion
