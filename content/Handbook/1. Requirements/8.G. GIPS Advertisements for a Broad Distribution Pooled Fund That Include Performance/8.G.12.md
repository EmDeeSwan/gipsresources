# 8.G.12
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose the [[BENCHMARK DESCRIPTION]], which must include the key features of the BENCHMARK or the name of the BENCHMARK for a readily recognized index or other point of reference.
## Discussion
Firms are required to disclose a description of each benchmark included in a GIPS Advertisement for a broad distribution pooled fund. The benchmark description is defined as general information regarding the investments, structure, and/or characteristics of the benchmark, and it must include the key features of the benchmark. In the case of a widely recognized benchmark, such as the S&P 500® Total Return Index, the name of the benchmark will satisfy this requirement. (S&P 500® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.) Each firm must decide for itself whether a benchmark is widely recognized. If the firm is not certain as to whether the benchmark is widely known, the firm must include the benchmark description.
### Sample Disclosure for a Widely Recognized Benchmark:
“The benchmark is the S&P 500® Index.”
### Sample Disclosure for a Benchmark That Is Not Widely Recognized:
“The benchmark is the XYZ World Total Return Index, which is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed market countries. The benchmark is market-cap weighted and is composed of all XYZ country-specific developed market indices.”
