## Standard for Firms
For REAL ESTATE investments that are not in a REAL ESTATE [[OPEN-END FUND]], the FIRM MUST disclose that:
- [[EXTERNAL VALUATION|EXTERNAL VALUATIONS]] are obtained, and the frequency with which they are obtained, or
- The FIRM relies on valuations from financial statement audits.

Required for periods ending on or after 31 December 2020.
## Discussion
According to Provision [[2.A.44]], for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012, real estate investments included in any portfolio except a real estate open-end fund must either:
- have an external valuation at least once every 12 months unless client agreements stipulate otherwise, in which case real estate investments must have an external valuation at least once every 36 months or per the client agreement if the investor agreement requires external valuations more frequently than every 36 months; or
- be subject to an annual financial statement audit performed by an independent public accounting firm. The real estate investments must be accounted for at fair value, and the most recent audited financial statements available must contain an unmodified opinion issued by an independent public accounting firm.

Because valuation is such an important issue for real estate investments, firms must inform prospective investors whether they externally value real estate investments and, if so, how frequently, or instead place reliance on valuations from audited financial statements. This disclosure is required for pooled funds that are not a real estate open-end fund, for periods ending on or after 31 December 2020.
### Sample Disclosures:
“ABC Company obtains external valuations for all real estate investments annually.”

“XYZ Company relies on valuations from audited financial statements. The audits are performed by an independent public accounting firm.”
