## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose which fees and expenses other than [[INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE|INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES]] (e.g., research costs) are separately charged by the FIRM to investors, if material.
## Discussion
Administrative fees and costs are typically paid from a pooled fund’s assets. Investment management fees may be paid from a pooled fund’s assets or may be separately charged to investors. In some cases, other fees and expenses, such as investment research costs, may be billed by the firm directly to the investor. When any fees and expenses other than investment management fees are separately charged by the firm to investors, and these fees and expenses are material, the firm must disclose which fees and expenses are separately charged. When determining if additional fees or expenses would be considered material, a firm must consider whether the additional fees or expenses are significant enough to reduce a prospective investor’s assessment of the attractiveness of the expected returns of the pooled fund relative to total fees charged. If so, the firm’s failure to disclose these additional fees or expenses would violate the principle of full disclosure.
### Sample Disclosure:
“In addition to the fees charged directly to the pooled fund and reflected in the pooled fund’s net return, investment research costs are charged directly to investors, as stipulated in the pooled fund offering memo.”
