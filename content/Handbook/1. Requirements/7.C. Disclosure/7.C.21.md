## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if [[POOLED FUND]] returns are gross or net of withholding taxes, if material.
## Discussion
Global investing requires recognition of the tax consequences of investing in different countries. The GIPS standards do not require firms to reflect withholding taxes, either reclaimable or non-reclaimable taxes, in a certain manner. Firms may choose whether or not to reflect the effect of withholding taxes when calculating performance. The GIPS standards do recommend that performance be reported net of non-reclaimable withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains and also recommend that reclaimable foreign withholding taxes be accrued (see Provision 2.B). If withholding taxes are material, firms must disclose how withholding taxes are treated when calculating performance. A firm must determine the level at which withholding taxes become material, document this level in its policies and procedures, and apply it consistently.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Pooled fund returns are net of all foreign non-reclaimable withholding taxes. Reclaimable withholding taxes are reflected as income if and when received.”
