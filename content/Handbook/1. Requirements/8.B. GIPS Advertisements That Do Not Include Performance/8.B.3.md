Links: [[8. GIPS Advertising Guidelines]]
___
# 8.B.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose how to obtain GIPS-compliant performance information for the FIRM’S strategies and products.
## Discussion
An advertisement is typically brief and provides limited information regarding the firm and its strategies and products. A reader of a GIPS Advertisement may want to receive additional information in order to have a more complete understanding of a firm’s investment offerings, including performance. It is, therefore, required that firms disclose in a GIPS Advertisement that does not include performance how to obtain GIPS-compliant performance information. GIPS-compliant performance information includes GIPS Reports and the firm’s required list of composite descriptions, list of limited distribution pooled fund descriptions, and list of broad distribution pooled funds.
