# 4.A.1.d
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]]:
- When the COMPOSITE terminates, the return from the last annual period end through the [[COMPOSITE TERMINATION DATE]].
## Discussion
The GIPS standards require that returns from the last annual period end through the composite termination date be presented for composites with a termination date of 1 January 2011 or later.  
Assume that a firm presents composite returns for annual periods ended 31 December and a composite terminates so that the track record ends 31 August 2017. The GIPS Composite Report for this composite must include the composite return for the period from 1 January 2017 through 31 August 2017. Partial-year returns must not be annualized. As an example, a composite that terminates on 31 January 2020 and has a one-month return for January 2020 of 3% (which equates to an annualized return of 42.6%) would be required to present that 3% as the partial year’s performance. The annualized return of 42.6% must not be presented. Some spreadsheet and software applications automatically annualize all returns, and firms are reminded that for periods of less than a year, the firm must “de-annualize” any annualized returns that are calculated.

The method chosen to de-annualize a return is at the discretion of the firm, but it must be a geometric calculation. In the situation just presented, the 42.6% annualized return could be de-an-nualized by one of the following formulas:

both resulting in a non-annualized one-month return of 3%.
