Links: [[4. Composite Time-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 4.A.12
## Standard for Firms
All REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED information in the [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] MUST be presented in the same currency.
## Discussion
Firms must present all required and recommended information in a GIPS Composite Report in the same currency (e.g., composite and benchmark returns, composite assets, and risk and internal dispersion measures). This requirement is not applicable to the fee schedule. Supplemental information should also be presented in the same currency. If it is not, that fact must be disclosed. Not disclosing this fact could be misleading.

If a firm chooses to present a composite in a different currency, the firm must convert all of the required information into the new currency. If the firm chooses to present performance in multiple currencies in the same GIPS Composite Report, the firm must convert all of the required information into each of the currencies and ensure it is clear in which currencies performance is reported. The firm must also convert any recommended information it chooses to present in the GIPS Composite Report containing the converted information.

In cases where a composite contains portfolios with different currencies, the firm must convert the individual portfolio returns to a single currency in order to calculate a composite return.

It is not permissible to do so by applying the exchange rate as of the current period end to historical data.

The GIPS standards do not require or recommend a particular method for converting portfolio performance from one currency to another. Two possible options for converting returns into a different currency are as follows:
- When using the aggregate method of composite calculation, convert the underlying data (values and external cash flows) into the selected currency using the exchange rate on the date of each cash flow and valuation, and then calculate the composite returns based on the converted data; or
- When using the weighted average method of composite calculation, first calculate the individual portfolio returns, then convert the portfolio returns into the selected currency, and calculate the weighted average composite return using the converted returns.

A firm may instead convert composite returns. Starting with composite returns calculated in its base currency, a composite return can be converted using the movement in the exchange rate between the base currency and the reporting currency over the period of the return. The following example illustrates this method:

Suppose that the return of a composite in euros for the year 2018 is +5.00%. The exchange rate for 1 euro to the US dollar at the start of the year was 1.2008, and at the end of the year it is 1.14315. First calculate the movement in the exchange rate over the year:

The exchange rate movement and the euro composite return are then multiplied to determine the USD composite return:

It is not acceptable to convert returns by applying the exchange rate as of the current period end to the historical data, including cash flows and valuations, used to calculate returns.

It is up to the firm to determine the composite-specific conversion method. Policies and procedures for converting returns must be established, documented, and applied consistently.
