# 4.A.1.a
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]]:
- At least five years of performance (or for the period since the [[COMPOSITE INCEPTION DATE]] if the COMPOSITE has been in existence less than five years) that meets the REQUIREMENTS of the GIPS standards. After the FIRM presents a minimum of five years of GIPS-compliant performance (or for the period since the [[COMPOSITE INCEPTION DATE]] if the COMPOSITE has been in existence less than five years), the FIRM MUST present an additional year of performance each year, building up to a minimum of 10 years of GIPS-compliant performance.
## Discussion
To claim compliance, a firm is required to meet all applicable requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis for at least a five-year period, or since inception of the firm if the firm has been in existence for less than five years. When initially claiming compliance with the GIPS standards, a firm must present a minimum of five years of composite performance or performance since the inception of the composite if the composite has been in existence for less than five years.

Once the firm has its initial minimum five years of GIPS-compliant history, the firm must continue to add annual returns to each GIPS Composite Report, so that five years after initially claiming compliance with the GIPS standards, the firm will have a 10-year performance record for its composites. It is recommended that firms present a compositeâ€™s history for more than the minimum required periods. (See Provision [[4.B.6]].)
