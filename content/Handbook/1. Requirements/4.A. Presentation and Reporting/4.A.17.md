___
# 4.A.17
## Standard for Firms
For [[WRAP FEE]] [[COMPOSITE|COMPOSITES]], when the FIRM presents PURE GROSS-OF-FEES returns, the FIRM MUST:
- Clearly label returns as PURE GROSS-OF-FEES.
- Identify PURE GROSS-OF-FEES returns as [[SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION]].
## Discussion
The GIPS standards require that transaction costs be deducted when calculating both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees returns. A pure gross-of-fees return is the return on investments that is not reduced by any transaction costs incurred during the period. If a firm presents pure gross-of-fees returns for a wrap fee composite, the returns must be clearly labeled as pure gross-of-fees returns and must also be identified as supplemental information. Supplemental information is any performance-related information included as part of a GIPS Composite Report that supplements or enhances the requirements and/or recommendations of the GIPS standards. The required labeling of a pure gross-of-fees return and its designation as supplemental information helps prospective clients distinguish pure gross-of-fees returns, which do not reflect the deduction of transaction costs, and gross-of-fees returns, which do reflect the deduction of transaction costs. (See Provision [[4.A.18]] for a discussion of supplemental information.)
