Links: [[4. Composite Time-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 4.A.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST clearly label or identify:
- The periods that are presented.
- If COMPOSITE returns are [[GROSS-OF-FEES]] or NET-OF-FEES.
## Discussion
All periods presented in a GIPS Composite Report must be clearly labeled or identified. This includes annual periods, partial-year periods, and any additional periods presented.

Firms may present either gross-of-fees composite returns or net-of-fees composite returns in a GIPS Composite Report and may also choose to present both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees returns. For prospective clients to understand the nature of the returns being presented, all returns presented must be clearly labeled or identified as gross-of-fees or net-of-fees.
