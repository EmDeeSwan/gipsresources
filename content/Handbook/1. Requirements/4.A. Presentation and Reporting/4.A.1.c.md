# 4.A.1.c
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]]:
- When the initial period is less than a full year, the return from the [[COMPOSITE INCEPTION DATE]] through the initial annual period end.
## Discussion
When a composite has an initial period that is less than a full year, the GIPS standards require that the return be presented for the partial year from the composite inception date through the initial annual period end. This is required for composites that begin on or after 1 January 2011. Although not required to do so for composites that begin prior to this date, firms should consider presenting the initial partial year of performance for all composites.

For example, assume that a firm presents composite returns for annual periods ended 31 December, and a new composite is created with a track record beginning 1 April 2018.  
The initial GIPS Composite Report for this composite must include the composite return for the period from 1 April 2018 through 31 December 2018. Subsequently, the firm must add annual returns, building up to a minimum 10-year track record.

Partial-year returns must not be annualized. As an example, a composite that began on 1 December 2020 and has a one-month initial return through 31 December 2020 of 3% (which equates to an annualized return of 42.6%) would be required to present that 3% as the partial year’s performance.  
The annualized return of 42.6% must not be presented. Some spreadsheet and software applications automatically annualize all returns, and firms are reminded that for periods of less than a year, the firm must “de-annualize” any annualized returns that are calculated.

The method chosen to de-annualize a return is at the discretion of the firm, but it must be a geometric calculation. In the situation just presented, the 42.6% annualized return could be de-annualized by one of the following formulas: both resulting in a non-annualized one-month return of 3%.
