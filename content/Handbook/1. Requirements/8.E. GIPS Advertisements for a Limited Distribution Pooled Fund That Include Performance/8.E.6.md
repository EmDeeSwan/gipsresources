___
# 8.E.6
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose the GIPS Advertising Guidelines compliance statement:  
“(Insert name of FIRM) claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).”
## Discussion
A firm has two ways of advertising its claim of compliance with the GIPS standards: 1) by following the GIPS Advertising Guidelines or 2) by including a GIPS Composite Report or a GIPS Pooled Fund Report in its advertisement. If a firm chooses to advertise its claim of compliance by following the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, it must include the following compliance statement in the GIPS Advertisement:
“(Insert name of firm) claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).”

The compliance statement required by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines is different from the compliance statement required to be disclosed in a GIPS Composite Report or GIPS Pooled Fund Report. The GIPS Advertising Guidelines compliance statement must appear exactly as presented in this provision and may not be reworded in any way. The English version of the compliance statement is the controlling version. If a firm chooses to translate the compliance statement into a language for which there is no official translation of the GIPS standards, the firm must take care to ensure that the translation used reflects the required wording of the compliance statement.
