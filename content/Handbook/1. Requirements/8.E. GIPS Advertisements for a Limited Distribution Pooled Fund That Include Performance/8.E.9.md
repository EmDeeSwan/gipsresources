___
# 8.E.9
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if the [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] conforms with laws or regulations that conflict with the REQUIREMENTS or RECOMMENDATIONS of the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, as well as the manner in which the laws or regulations conflict with the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.
## Discussion
Firms must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance, including the advertising of performance. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, however, does not necessarily result in compliance with the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. Firms must also comply with all of the applicable requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines when preparing an advertisement in accordance with the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. When laws and regulations conflict with the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, firms are required to comply with the laws and regulations and disclose the manner in which the laws or regulations conflict with the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.

This disclosure will assist readers of the GIPS Advertisement in comparing GIPS Advertisements among firms where reporting requirements may differ because of local laws or regulations.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Local laws do not allow the presentation of returns of less than one year in an advertisement, which is in conflict with the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. Therefore, no performance is presented for this pooled fund for the period from 1 July 2018 (the inception date of the pooled fund) through 31 December 2018.”
