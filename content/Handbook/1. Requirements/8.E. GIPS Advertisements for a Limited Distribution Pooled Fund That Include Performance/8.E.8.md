Links: [[8. GIPS Advertising Guidelines]]
___
# 8.E.8
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose how to obtain a [[GIPS REPORT]].
## Discussion
An advertisement is typically brief and provides limited information regarding the firm and its strategies and products. A reader of a GIPS Advertisement may want to receive additional information on the firm’s investment strategies and pooled funds, including a GIPS Report for the pooled fund presented in the advertisement. It is, therefore, required that firms disclose in a GIPS Advertisement how to obtain a GIPS Report.
### Sample Disclosure for a Limited Distribution Pooled Fund:
“To receive additional information regarding Ava Advisors, including a GIPS Report for the pooled fund presented in this advertisement, contact Lucia Bear at +41 34 5678910 or write Ava Advisors, One Squirrel Street, Uetikon, Switzerland or `lbear@avaadvisors.com.`”
