Links: [[5. Composite Money-Weighted Return Report]], [[5.A.1]]
___
# 5.A.1.b
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]]:
- When the COMPOSITE has a track record that is less than a full year, the non-annualized COMPOSITE SINCE-INCEPTION [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN]] through the initial annual period end.
## Discussion
When a composite has a track record of less than a full year, the firm must present the non-annu-alized since-inception money-weighted return (SI-MWR) through the initial annual period end. Subsequently, the firm must extend the measurement period for the SI-MWR to include the next annual period and calculate an annualized SI-MWR through the most recent annual period end.

SI-MWRs for periods of less than a full year must not be annualized. As an example, a composite that began on 1 December 2020 and has a one-month initial return through 31 December 2020 of 3% (which equates to an annualized return of 42.6%) would be required to present that 3% as the partial year’s performance. The annualized return of 42.6% must not be presented. Some spreadsheet and software applications automatically annualize all returns, and firms are reminded that for periods of less than a year, the firm must “de-annualize” any annualized returns that are calculated.

The method chosen to de-annualize a return is at the discretion of the firm, but it must be a geometric calculation. In the situation just presented, the 42.6% annualized return could be de-annu-alized by one of the following formulas:

both resulting in a non-annualized one-month return of 3%.
