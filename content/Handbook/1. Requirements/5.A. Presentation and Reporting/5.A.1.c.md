Links: [[5. Composite Money-Weighted Return Report]], [[5.A.1]]
___
# 5.A.1.c
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]]:
- When the COMPOSITE terminates, the annualized COMPOSITE SINCE-INCEPTION [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN]] through the composite TERMINATION DATE.
## Discussion
When a composite terminates, the firm must present the annualized composite since-inception money-weighted return (SI-MWR) through the composite termination date. For example, if a composite has an inception date of 1 July 2012 and terminates on 31 August 2019, the GIPS Composite Report for this composite must include a composite SI-MWR for the period from 1 July 2012 through 31 August 2019.
