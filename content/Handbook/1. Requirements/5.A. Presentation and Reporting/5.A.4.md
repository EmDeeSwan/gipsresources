Links: [[5. Composite Money-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 5.A.4
## Standard for Firms
If PORTFOLIOS in the [[COMPOSITE]] have [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]], the FIRM MUST present the following items as of the most recent annual period end:
1. COMPOSITE SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]].
2. COMPOSITE SINCE-INCEPTION [[DISTRIBUTION|DISTRIBUTIONS]].
3. COMPOSITE cumulative [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]].
4. TOTAL VALUE TO SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] ([[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|INVESTMENT MULTIPLE]] or [[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]]).
5. SINCE-INCEPTION [[DISTRIBUTION|DISTRIBUTIONS]] to SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] ([[DPI (REALIZATION MULTIPLE)|REALIZATION MULTIPLE or DPI]]).
6. SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] to cumulative [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]] ([[PIC MULTIPLE]]).
7. RESIDUAL VALUE to SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] (UNREALIZED MULTIPLE or RVPI).
## Discussion
Although the money-weighted return (MWR) is the basic metric used to report performance for composites in which the firm has control over the cash flows, has met the other requirements for presenting an MWR, and has chosen to present MWRs, it is not the only useful metric used to gauge performance. Other measures are also useful to provide additional insight. The MWR by its nature is sensitive to early cash flow events, and the MWR calculation assumes that the residual value, or fair value, of a composite is totally liquid – whereas, in reality, the residual value may be illiquid. Other metrics have been developed that allow a prospective client to examine aspects of performance other than simply a rate of return.

1. Composite since-inception paid-in capital.
	The composite since-inception paid-in capital consists of all capital inflows to portfolios within a composite by clients or investors (e.g., limited partners). These inflows are also referred to as contributions to a composite by clients or investors. Paid-in capital also includes distributions that are subsequently recalled and reinvested into the composite.

2. Composite since-inception distributions.
	The composite since-inception distributions includes all cash and stock distributed to composite clients or investors (e.g., limited partners).

3. Composite cumulative committed capital.
	The composite cumulative committed capital represents the total pledges of capital to a composite by clients or investors (e.g., limited partners). Committed capital can be either drawn (paid-in) or undrawn (dry powder).

4. Total value to since-inception paid-in capital (investment multiple or [[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]]).
	The investment multiple, or [[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]], provides prospective clients or investors with a multiple that indicates how many times more the investment is worth compared with the original investment without taking into account the time value of money. Also known as the Multiple of Investment Capital (MOIC), it is equal to the sum of the composite since-inception distributions and its residual value (i.e., fair value) divided by the composite since-inception paid-in capital. The investment multiple is calculated as follows:

	[[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]] can also be calculated as DPI + RVPI, where	
		DPI = realization multiple (see Provision 5.A.4.e)
		RVPI = unrealized multiple (see Provision 5.A.4.g)

5. Since-inception distributions to since-inception paid-in capital (realization multiple or DPI).
	The DPI, or realization multiple, measures how much invested capital has actually been returned to clients or investors. It is the amount of invested capital that has been “realized” by clients or investors and is often viewed as the amount of the [[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]] that is “realized.” [[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]], also known as the investment multiple, is calculated as total value divided by since-inception paid-in capital. (See Provision 5.A.4.d.) DPI is calculated as follows:

6. Since-inception paid-in capital to cumulative committed capital (pic multiple).
	The paid-in capital multiple, also known as the PIC multiple or PIC ratio, gives prospective clients or investors information regarding how much committed capital has actually been drawn down or called. It is also known as the “dry-powder ratio” because it measures how much capital has already been invested and therefore indicates how much capital is left to invest. The PIC multiple is calculated as follows:
	
	![](https://www.gipsstandards.org/wp-content/themes/gips/pdf_img/for_firms/4.A.1.26.png)
	
	Distributions can be either recallable or non-recallable. If a distribution is recallable, after the firm distributes proceeds to its clients or investors, it can draw down the same capital again, which makes it possible for the composite to have since-inception paid-in capital in excess of its total committed capital. A recallable distribution must be treated as an actual distribution and, if and when that distribution is recalled (drawn again), it must be treated as additional paid-in capital.
	
	Recallable distributions affect the performance metric calculations. Firms may wish to consider additional disclosure when there is a material effect on the PIC or realization multiples. If a recallable distribution is re-contributed and reflected as paid-in capital a second time, the result will be that cumulative paid-in capital since inception is higher than total committed capital. It also means that the realization multiple (DPI), unrealized multiple (RVPI), and investment multiple ([[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]]) will be lower. (For more information on DPI, RVPI, and [[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]], please see Provisions 5.A.4.e, 5.A.4.g, and 5.A.4.d, respectively.) All else being equal, for composites that have had recallable distributions, the denominator will be increased and the PIC multiple will be higher.

7. Residual value to since-inception paid-in-capital (unrealized multiple or rvpi).
	The unrealized multiple, or RVPI, is the converse of the realization multiple. It is equal to the composite’s residual value (or fair value) at the end of the period divided by since-inception paid-in capital. It is calculated as follows:
