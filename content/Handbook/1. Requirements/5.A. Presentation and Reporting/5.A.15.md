___
# 5.A.15
## Standard for Firms
Any [[SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION]] included in the [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]]:
- MUST relate directly to the [[COMPOSITE]].
- MUST NOT contradict or conflict with the REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED information in the [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]].
- MUST be clearly labeled as [[SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION]].
## Discussion
Supplemental information is any performance-related information included as part of a GIPS Composite Report that supplements or enhances the requirements and/or recommendations of the GIPS standards. Performance-related information includes:
- information expressed in terms of investment return and risk, and
- other information and input data that directly relate to the calculation of investment return and risk (e.g., composite holdings), as well as information derived from investment return and risk input data (e.g., performance contribution or attribution).

Supplemental information should provide users of the GIPS Composite Report with the proper context in which to understand the performance results. Common examples of supplemental information for a GIPS Composite Report that presents money-weighted returns (MWRs) include the following:
- segment MWRs that do not include cash,
- projected investment-level MWRs,
- projected multiples, and
- benchmark time-weighted returns.

Supplemental information must relate directly to the composite and must not contradict or conflict with the required or recommended information in the GIPS Composite Report. Examples of information that relates directly to the composite and would be considered supplemental information include segment returns (e.g., country or sector), performance attribution, and composite or portfolio-level holdings. An example of information that would conflict with the GIPS standards is an MWR that includes data from a past firm when the data does not meet the portability tests specified in Provision [[1.A.32]].

The following is a more complete list of the principles that apply when supplemental information is presented. Supplemental information must:
- satisfy the spirit and principles of the GIPS standards â€“ fair representation and full disclosure,
- comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance,
- not include performance or performance-related information that is false or misleading,
- relate directly to the composite and supplement or enhance the required or recommended information included in the GIPS Composite Report,
- not contradict or conflict with the required or recommended information in the GIPS Composite Report,
- be clearly labeled as supplemental information, and
- not be shown with greater prominence than the required composite information.
