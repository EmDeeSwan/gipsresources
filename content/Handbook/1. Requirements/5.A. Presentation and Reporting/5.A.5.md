Links: [[5. Composite Money-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 5.A.5
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST clearly label or identify:
- The periods that are presented.
- If [[COMPOSITE]] returns are [[GROSS-OF-FEES]] or NET-OF-FEES.
- If [[COMPOSITE]] returns do or do not reflect the SUBSCRIPTION LINE OF CREDIT. This information is REQUIRED only if the firm presents returns both with and without the SUBSCRIPTION LINE OF CREDIT.
## Discussion
All periods presented in a GIPS Composite Report must be clearly labeled or identified.

Firms may present either gross-of-fees composite returns or net-of-fees composite returns in a GIPS Composite Report and may also choose to present both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees returns. For prospective clients to understand the nature of the returns being presented, the returns included in a GIPS Composite Report must be clearly labeled or identified as either gross-of-fees or net-of-fees.

If a firm uses a subscription line of credit (LOC), and it is required to present returns both with and without the subscription LOC, the firm must clearly indicate whether the composite returns do or do not reflect the subscription LOC. If no subscription LOC is used, or the firm is not required to present returns both with and without the subscription LOC, this disclosure is not required.
