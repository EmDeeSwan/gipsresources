# 5.C.23
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose:
- The minimum asset level, if any, below which portfolios are not included in the [[COMPOSITE]].
- Any changes to the minimum asset level.
## Discussion
The firm may establish a minimum asset level for a composite to exclude portfolios that are too small to be representative of the intended strategy. Firms must disclose the minimum asset level of the composite, if one exists, in each respective GIPS Composite Report. If any changes have been made to the minimum asset level of a composite, the firm must document and disclose changes to the minimum asset level and must not retroactively apply the new limit. See the discussion of Provision [[3.A.11]] for additional guidance on composite minimums.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The minimum portfolio size for inclusion in the LMN Composite is €500,000. Prior to 2018, there was no minimum.”
