## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose which fees and expenses other than [[INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE|INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES]] (e.g., research costs) are separately charged by the FIRM to clients, if material.
## Discussion
Clients typically bear investment management fees and transaction costs. In some cases, however, firms may charge fees or expenses, such as investment research costs, directly to clients. When any fees or expenses other than investment management fees are separately charged by the firm to clients, and these fees or expenses are material, the firm must disclose which fees and expenses are separately charged. When determining if additional fees or expenses would be considered material, a firm must consider whether the additional fees or expenses are significant enough to reduce a prospective client’s assessment of the attractiveness of the expected returns of the strategy relative to total fees charged. If so, the firm’s failure to disclose these additional fees or expenses would violate the principle of full disclosure.
### Sample Disclosure:
“In addition to investment management fees and transaction costs, certain investment research costs are charged directly to clients, as stipulated in client agreements.”
