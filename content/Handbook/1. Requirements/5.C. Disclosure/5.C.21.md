## Standard for Firms
If the COMPOSITE is redefined, the FIRM MUST disclose the date and description of the redefinition.
## Discussion
Investment strategies can change over time. In some cases, such a change results in the termination of one composite and the creation of a new composite. In other cases, it may be appropriate to redefine the composite. If a composite is redefined, the firm must disclose the date and description of the redefinition. See Provision [[3.A.5]] for guidance on composite definitions.
### Sample Disclosure:
“As of 1 July 2017, the fixed-income strategy includes the use of interest rate futures to modify duration and manage interest rate risk. Prior to this date, the Composite’s strategy did not involve the active management of interest rate risk.”
