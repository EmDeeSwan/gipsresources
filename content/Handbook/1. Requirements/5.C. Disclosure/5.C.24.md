___
# 5.C.24
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if COMPOSITE returns are gross or net of withholding taxes, if material.
## Discussion
Global investing requires recognition of the tax consequences of investing in different countries. The GIPS standards do not require firms to reflect withholding taxes, either reclaimable or non-reclaimable taxes, in a certain manner. Firms may choose whether or not to reflect the effect of withholding taxes when calculating performance. The GIPS standards do recommend that performance be reported net of non-reclaimable withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains and also recommend that reclaimable foreign withholding taxes be accrued (see Provision [[2.B.5]]). If withholding taxes are material, firms must disclose how withholding taxes are treated when calculating performance. A firm must determine the level at which withholding taxes become material, document this level in its policies and procedures, and apply it consistently.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Portfolio returns are net of all foreign non-reclaimable withholding taxes. Reclaimable withholding taxes are reflected as income if and when received.”
