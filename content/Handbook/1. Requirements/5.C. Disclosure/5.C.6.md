## Standard for Firms
When presenting [[GROSS-OF-FEES]] returns, the FIRM MUST disclose if any other fees are deducted in addition to [[TRANSACTION COSTS]].
## Discussion
A gross-of-fees return is the return on investments reduced by any transaction costs. If a firm presents a gross-of-fees return in a GIPS Composite Report, the firm must disclose if any other fees are deducted in addition to transaction costs (e.g., custody fees).

In cases where fees other than transactions costs have been deducted from the gross-of-fees returns, this disclosure helps prospective clients understand the gross-of-fees returns being presented and therefore compare performance across firms.

In some markets, brokers offer zero-commission trades. If a portfolio is paying zero commissions, then it is appropriate to calculate portfolio gross-of-fees returns that reflect zero transaction costs. When a composite includes portfolios that pay zero commissions, firms should disclose this fact. Not disclosing this fact could be misleading.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Gross-of-fees returns reflect the deduction of transaction costs and custodian fees but do not reflect the deduction of investment management fees.”
