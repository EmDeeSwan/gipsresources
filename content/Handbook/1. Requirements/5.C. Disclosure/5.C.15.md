## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose that policies for valuing investments, calculating performance, and preparing GIPS REPORTS are available upon request.
## Discussion
In each GIPS Composite Report, firms must disclose the availability of policies for valuing investments, calculating performance, and preparing GIPS Reports. The policies are not required to be included in each GIPS Composite Report but must be readily available upon request. Firms are not required to provide the related procedures, in addition to the policies, but may do so.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Firm XYZ’s policies for valuing investments, calculating performance, and preparing GIPS Reports are available upon request.”
