## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose the [[COMPOSITE INCEPTION DATE]].
## Discussion
When reviewing the performance data in a GIPS Composite Report, it is important that prospective clients have sufficient information regarding the length of the composite track record to put the performance presented in the GIPS Composite Report in perspective. Therefore, the inception date of the composite being presented in the GIPS Composite Report must be disclosed. If there has been a break in the performance record of a composite, the initial inception date before the break is the date that would be disclosed.
### Sample Disclosures:
“The Global Growth Composite has an inception date of 15 September 2019, the date on which the first portfolio in the composite experienced its first capital call from the limited partners.”

“The Global Fixed Income Composite has an inception date of 1 November 2015. There was a break in performance from 1 March 2019 through 30 November 2019. During that period, there were no portfolios in the composite. Composite performance began again on 1 December 2019.”
