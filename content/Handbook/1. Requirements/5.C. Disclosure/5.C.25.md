___
# 5.C.25
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if BENCHMARK returns are net of withholding taxes if this information is available.
## Discussion
Global investing requires recognition of the tax consequences of investing in different countries. The GIPS standards do not require firms to reflect withholding taxes, either reclaimable or non-reclaimable taxes, in a certain manner. Firms may choose whether or not to reflect the effect of withholding taxes when calculating composite performance and, similarly, whether or not to use a benchmark that reflects the effect of withholding taxes.

As Provision [[5.C.24]] indicates, if withholding taxes are material, firms must disclose how withholding taxes are treated when calculating performance. To facilitate the comparison of composite returns and benchmark returns, firms must also disclose if the benchmark returns are net of withholding taxes if this information is available. If the benchmark name indicates that the benchmark is net of withholding taxes, no additional disclosure is necessary.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Benchmark returns are net of withholding taxes.”
