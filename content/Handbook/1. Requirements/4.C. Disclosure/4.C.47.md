Links: [[4. Composite Time-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 4.C.47
## Standard for Firms
For [[WRAP FEE]] [[COMPOSITE|COMPOSITES]], when the FIRM presents PURE GROSS-OF-FEES returns, the FIRM MUST disclose that pure GROSS-OF-FEES returns do not reflect the deduction of [[TRANSACTION COSTS]].
## Discussion
When presenting information for a wrap fee composite to a wrap fee prospective client, firms may present pure gross-of-fees returns as supplemental information. Unlike a gross-of-fees or net-of-fees return, a pure gross-of-fees return is one that does not reflect the deduction of any transaction costs incurred during the period. Some prospective clients may not be aware of what a pure gross-of-fees return represents. Therefore, in addition to requiring that a pure gross-of-fees return be clearly labeled and identified as supplemental information (Provision [[4.A.17]]), it is required that the firm disclose that pure gross-of-fees returns do not reflect the deduction of transaction costs.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The pure gross-of-fees returns do not reflect the deduction of transaction costs.”
