___
# 4.C.37
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if performance from a past firm or affiliation is presented, and for which periods.
## Discussion
Provision [[1.A.32]] includes the portability tests that must be met to determine if performance from a past firm or affiliation may be used to represent the historical performance of a new or acquiring firm and if that performance can be linked to the ongoing performance of the new or acquiring firm. Provision [[1.A.33]] includes the portability tests that must be met for the new or acquiring firm to use performance from a past firm or affiliation to represent its historical performance when there is a break in the track record between the past firm or affiliation and the new or acquiring firm. In this instance, the track record from the past firm or affiliation may be used if the tests are met, but it must not be linked to the performance of the new or acquiring firm.

If the firm meets the required portability tests and presents performance from a past firm or affiliation in the GIPS Composite Report, the firm must disclose this fact, as well as the periods for which performance from the past firm or affiliation is presented.
### Sample Disclosure:
