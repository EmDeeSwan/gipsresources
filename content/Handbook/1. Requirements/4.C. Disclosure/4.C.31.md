## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM determines no appropriate BENCHMARK for the COMPOSITE exists, the FIRM MUST disclose why no BENCHMARK is presented.
## Discussion
Benchmarks are important tools that aid in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of an investment strategy. They also help facilitate discussions with prospective clients regarding the relationship between composite risk and return. As a result, the GIPS standards require firms to provide benchmark total returns in all GIPS Composite Reports. The benchmark must reflect the investment mandate, objective, or strategy of the composite. Although there is typically an appropriate benchmark for traditional strategies, it is more common for managers of alternative strategies to determine that no appropriate benchmark for the composite exists. If this is the case, the firm must disclose why no benchmark is presented.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Because the composite’s strategy is absolute return where investments are permitted in all asset classes, no benchmark is presented because we believe that no benchmark that reflects this strategy exists.”
