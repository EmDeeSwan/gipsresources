# 4.C.20
## Standard for Firms
For any performance presented for periods prior to the [[MINIMUM EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE DATE]] that does not comply with the GIPS standards, the FIRM MUST disclose the periods of non-compliance.
## Discussion
Firms may link non-GIPS compliant performance to their GIPS-compliant performance provided that only GIPS-compliant performance is presented for periods beginning on or after the minimum effective compliance date, which is 1 January 2006 for private equity and real estate composites and pooled funds and wrap fee composites, and 1 January 2000 for all other composites and pooled funds. If the firm chooses to present non-compliant performance for periods prior to the minimum effective compliance date, the firm must disclose which periods are not in compliance. Prospective clients and existing clients can then inquire about the reasons why the periods prior to the minimum effective compliance date are not compliant and consider the effects of non-compliance on the historical performance.

If non-compliant performance is included in a GIPS Composite Report after the minimum effective date, it must be labeled as supplemental information and must not be linked to the GIPS-compliant performance.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The performance record for 1995 through 1999 is not in compliance with the GIPS standards.”
