## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose if the COMPOSITE’S valuation hierarchy materially differs from the RECOMMENDED valuation hierarchy. (See Provision [[2.B.6]] for the recommended valuation hierarchy.)
## Discussion
Firms must establish policies and procedures for determining portfolio valuations. For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, those valuations must be determined in accordance with the definition of fair value. Provision [[2.B.6]] includes a recommended valuation hierarchy that firms should incorporate into their policies and procedures for determining fair value for portfolio investments. Firms must establish a valuation hierarchy on a composite-specific basis. It is acceptable for firms to apply a different valuation hierarchy to specific composites provided the valuation methodology conforms to the definition of fair value. If the valuation hierarchy materially differs from the recommended valuation hierarchy, the firm must disclose this fact. Prospective clients will be informed and then may request additional information about the firm’s valuation policies.
### Sample Disclosure:
“All portfolio investments are valued using the firm’s proprietary valuation models to determine fair value. Our valuation procedures materially differ from the recommended valuation hierarchy in the GIPS standards.”
