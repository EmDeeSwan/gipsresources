## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose changes to the name of the [[COMPOSITE]]. This disclosure MUST be included for a minimum of one year and for as long as it is relevant to interpreting the track record.
## Discussion
When prospective clients are evaluating composites over time and across firms, it is important that they understand exactly which composites they are assessing. If a firm changes the name of a composite, the change must be disclosed in the GIPS Composite Report. The name change must be disclosed for a minimum of one year and potentially for more than one year if the firm determines the disclosure is still relevant and meaningful. The firm must consider the underlying principles of the GIPS standards, which are fair representation and full disclosure, when determining how long the disclosure will be included in the GIPS Composite Report.
### Sample Disclosure:
“As of 1 January 2016, the XYZ Index Composite was renamed the US Equity Large Cap Composite.”
