Links: [[4. Composite Time-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 4.C.10
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose which measure of [[INTERNAL DISPERSION]] is presented.
## Discussion
The GIPS standards do not mandate that a specific measure of a composite’s internal dispersion must be included in a GIPS Composite Report. Instead, firms are permitted to choose a measure for each composite and apply it consistently. (See Provision [[4.A.1.i]].) Because firms may choose which measure of internal dispersion to present, disclosure of the chosen measure is required in the GIPS Composite Report to help prospective clients understand which measure of internal dispersion is being presented.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Internal dispersion is calculated using the equal-weighted standard deviation of the annual gross returns of those portfolios that were included in the composite for the entire year.”
