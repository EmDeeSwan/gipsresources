# 7.A.1.e
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]]:
- POOLED FUND assets as of the most recent annual period end.
## Discussion
Each GIPS Pooled Fund Report must include the pooled fund assets as of the most recent annual period end. This requirement provides information to prospective investors on the size of the pooled fund, measured by the amount of assets it contains. When the pooled fund strategy uses discretionary leverage, pooled fund assets must be presented net of the discretionary leverage and not grossed up as if the discretionary leverage did not exist. Discretionary leverage refers to loans taken at the discretion of the firm. In contrast, non-discretionary leverage refers to borrowings undertaken by the investor. For example, if the firm is managing a fund that has $200 million in assets, and the firm chooses to borrow $50 million, the fundâ€™s net assets are $200 million and its gross assets are $250 million. When calculating pooled fund assets, the firm must use $200 million.
