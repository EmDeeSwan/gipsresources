Links: [[7. Pooled Fund Money-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 7.A.5
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST clearly label or identify:
- The periods that are presented.
- If POOLED FUND returns are POOLED FUND GROSS RETURNS or [[POOLED FUND NET RETURN|POOLED FUND NET RETURNS]].
- If POOLED FUND returns do or do not reflect the [[SUBSCRIPTION LINE OF CREDIT]]. This information is REQUIRED only if the firm PRESENTS returns both with and without the [[SUBSCRIPTION LINE OF CREDIT]].
## Discussion
All periods presented in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report must be clearly labeled or identified.

Firms may present pooled fund gross returns or pooled fund net returns in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report and may also choose to present both pooled fund gross returns and pooled fund net returns. For prospective investors to understand the nature of the returns being presented, the returns included in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report must be clearly labeled or identified as either gross returns or net returns.

If a firm uses a subscription line of credit (LOC), and it is required to present returns both with and without this subscription LOC, the firm must clearly indicate whether the pooled fund returns do or do not reflect the subscription LOC. If no subscription LOC is used or the firm is not required to present returns both with and without the subscription LOC, this disclosure is not required.
