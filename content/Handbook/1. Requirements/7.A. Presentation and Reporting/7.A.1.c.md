Links: [[7. Pooled Fund Money-Weighted Return Report]], [[7.A.1]]
___
# 7.A.1.c
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present in each [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]]:
- When the POOLED FUND terminates, the annualized POOLED FUND [[SINCE-INCEPTION]] [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN]] through the POOLED FUND TERMINATION DATE.
## Discussion
When a pooled fund terminates, the firm must present the annualized pooled fund since-inception money-weighted return (SI-MWR) through the pooled fund termination date. For example, if a pooled fund has an inception date of 1 July 2012 and terminates on 31 August 2019, the GIPS Pooled Fund Report for this pooled fund must include a pooled fund SI-MWR for the period from 1 July 2012 through 31 August 2019.
