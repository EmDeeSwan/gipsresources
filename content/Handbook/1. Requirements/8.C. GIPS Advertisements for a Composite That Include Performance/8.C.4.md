# 8.C.4
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST present BENCHMARK returns for the same BENCHMARK as presented in the corresponding [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]], if the corresponding [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] includes BENCHMARK returns. BENCHMARK returns MUST be of the same return type ([[TIME-WEIGHTED RETURN|TIME-WEIGHTED RETURNS]] or [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN|MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURNS]]), in the same currency, and for the same periods for which the [[COMPOSITE]] returns are presented.
## Discussion
As described in Provisions [[8.C.1]] and [[8.C.2]], firms that present performance in a GIPS Advertisement for a composite have various options for the time periods used in presenting time-weighted returns (TWRs) and money-weighted returns (MWRs). Once an option is selected, the firm must present the total returns for the benchmark(s) for the same periods as the composite returns. The benchmark must be the same benchmark as presented in the corresponding GIPS Composite Report and must also be the same return type (TWR or MWR) and in the same currency as the composite returns. If more than one benchmark is included in the GIPS Composite Report, the firm should consider whether multiple benchmarks should be presented in the GIPS Advertisement.

This requirement is an acknowledgement that a comparison of benchmark and composite returns will help the reader of the GIPS Advertisement determine how well the composite has performed relative to the benchmark.
