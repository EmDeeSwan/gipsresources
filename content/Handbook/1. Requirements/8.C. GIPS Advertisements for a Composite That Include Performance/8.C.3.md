___
# 8.C.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST clearly label composite returns as [[GROSS-OF-FEES]] or NET-OF-FEES.
## Discussion
Firms may present either gross-of-fees composite returns or net-of-fees composite returns in a GIPS Advertisement and may also choose to present both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees returns. For prospective clients to understand the nature of the returns being presented, all returns presented must be clearly labeled as gross-of-fees or net-of-fees.

A firm may present net-of-fees returns in a GIPS Advertisement even if the corresponding GIPS Composite Report includes only gross-of-fees returns, or the firm may present gross-of-fees returns even if the corresponding GIPS Composite Report presents only net-of-fees returns, as long as the returns presented in the GIPS Advertisement are derived from the returns that would be included in the corresponding GIPS Composite Report.

Firms advertising performance results must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, including those governing advertisements. In some jurisdictions, laws or regulations require performance in an advertisement to be presented net-of-fees. Whether or not laws or regulations specify which returns must be presented in an advertisement, firms must clearly indicate whether returns are presented gross-of-fees or net-of-fees so that the reader of the advertisement has a clear understanding of the returns that are presented.
