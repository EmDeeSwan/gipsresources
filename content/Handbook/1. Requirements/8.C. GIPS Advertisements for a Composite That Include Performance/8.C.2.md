# 8.C.2
## Standard for Firms
If [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN|MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURNS]] are presented in the corresponding [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]], the FIRM MUST present the annualized (for periods longer than one year) or non-annualized (for periods less than one year) [[COMPOSITE]] SINCE-INCEPTION [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN]] through either:
- The most recent period end, or
- The most recent annual period end.
## Discussion
If the firm meets the criteria to present a money-weighted return (MWR) instead of a time-weighted return in a GIPS Composite Report (see Provision [[1.A.35]]) and has chosen to do so, it must present an MWR in the corresponding GIPS Advertisement. The return presented must be the annualized (for periods longer than one year) or non-annualized (for periods less than one year) since-inception MWR through either: a) the most recent period end (i.e., through the most recent month or quarter end) or b) the most recent annual period end.

In the spirit of fair representation and full disclosure, Provision [[8.A.7]] requires that all composite returns included in a GIPS Advertisement must be derived from the returns that have been included in or that will be included in the corresponding GIPS Composite Report. This requirement is to ensure consistency in the performance reported by a firm. If a GIPS Advertisement is more current than the corresponding GIPS Composite Report, it is permissible to include more-recent performance in the GIPS Advertisement, as long as this performance will be included in the GIPS Composite Report when it is updated or would be included in the GIPS Composite Report if it were issued as of the date of the GIPS Advertisement.
