___
# 8.C.5
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose or otherwise indicate the reporting currency.
## Discussion
The GIPS standards require that firms disclose the currency used to report the numerical information presented in a GIPS Advertisement. If the firm presents performance in multiple currencies in the same GIPS Advertisement, the firm must ensure it is clear which currencies are used to calculate and report performance.

Labeling the columns within a GIPS Advertisement with the appropriate currency symbol would satisfy this requirement, as would a written disclosure. If firms advertise the strategy outside their home market, they should consider whether the currency symbol alone is sufficient. For example, a Canadian firm advertising only in Canada may decide to present only the $ symbol. If the firm advertises the strategy in both the United States and Canada, the firm must disclose whether the currency is USD or CAD, because both currencies use the same currency symbol.

All required and recommended information presented in a GIPS Advertisement must be presented in the same currency. (See Provision [[8.A.14]])
### Sample Disclosures
“Valuations are computed and all information is reported in Canadian dollars.”

“Performance is reported in Japanese yen.”
