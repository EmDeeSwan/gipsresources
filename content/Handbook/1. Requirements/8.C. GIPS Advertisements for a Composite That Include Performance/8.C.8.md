Links: [[8. GIPS Advertising Guidelines]]
___
# 8.C.8
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST disclose how to obtain a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]].
## Discussion
An advertisement is typically brief and provides limited information regarding the firm and its strategies and products. A reader of a GIPS Advertisement may want to receive additional information on the firm’s investment strategies, including a GIPS Composite Report for the strategy presented in the advertisement. Firms are, therefore, required to disclose in a GIPS Advertisement how to obtain a GIPS Composite Report.
### Sample Disclosure for a Composite:
“To receive additional information regarding Ava Advisors, including a GIPS Composite Report for the strategy presented in this advertisement, contact Lucia Bear at +41 34 5678910 or write Ava Advisors, One Squirrel Street, Uetikon, Switzerland or `lbear@avaadvisors.com.`”
