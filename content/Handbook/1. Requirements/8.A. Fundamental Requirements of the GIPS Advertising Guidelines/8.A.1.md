___
# 8.A.1
## Standard for Firms
The GIPS Advertising Guidelines apply only to firms that already claim compliance with the GIPS standards.
## Discussion
A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards has three options with respect to preparing an advertisement:
- Prepare the advertisement in accordance with the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.
- Include a GIPS Report in the advertisement.
- Do not mention the GIPS standards in the advertisement.

A firm that chooses to claim compliance in an advertisement must either meet the requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines or include a GIPS Report in the advertisement. Firms are not required to claim compliance with the GIPS standards in advertisements.

Firms claiming compliance with the GIPS standards must ensure that all performance or performance-related information in marketing materials is not false or misleading and adheres to the guiding principles of fair representation and full disclosure, whether or not the materials contain a claim of compliance with the GIPS standards.
