___
# 8.A.8
## Standard for Firms
Disclosures included in a [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] for a [[COMPOSITE]] MUST be consistent with the related disclosure included in the corresponding [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]], unless the disclosure included in the [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] is more current and has not yet been reflected in the corresponding [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]].
## Discussion
In the spirit of fair representation and full disclosure, all disclosures included in a GIPS Advertisement must be consistent with the disclosures that have been included in or that will be included in the corresponding GIPS Composite Report. This requirement is to ensure consistency in information reported by a firm. If a GIPS Advertisement is more current than the corresponding GIPS Composite Report, it is permissible to include a more current disclosure in the GIPS Advertisement, as long as the more current disclosure will be included in the GIPS Composite Report when it is updated or would be included in the GIPS Composite Report if it were issued as of the date of the GIPS Advertisement.
