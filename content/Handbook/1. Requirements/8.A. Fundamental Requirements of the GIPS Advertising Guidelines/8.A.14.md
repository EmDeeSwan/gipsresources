Links: [[8. GIPS Advertising Guidelines]]
___
# 8.A.14
## Standard for Firms
All REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED information in a [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] MUST be presented in the same currency.
## Discussion
Firms must present all required and recommended information in a GIPS Advertisement in the same currency (e.g., composite or pooled fund and benchmark returns). Any information beyond what is required or recommended by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines should also be presented in the same currency. If it is not, that fact must be disclosed. It would be misleading for the firm to not disclose this fact.

If a firm chooses to present a composite or pooled fund in a different currency, the firm must convert all of the required information into the new currency. If the firm chooses to present performance in multiple currencies in the same GIPS Advertisement, the firm must convert all of the required information into each of the currencies and ensure it is clear in which currencies performance is reported. The firm must also convert any recommended information it chooses to present in the GIPS Advertisement containing the converted information. See Provision [[4.A.12]] for guidance on converting composite time-weighted returns and Provision [[7.A.12]] for converting pooled fund money-weighted returns.
