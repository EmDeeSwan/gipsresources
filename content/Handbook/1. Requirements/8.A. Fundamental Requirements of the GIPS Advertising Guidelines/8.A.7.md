___
# 8.A.7
## Standard for Firms
[[COMPOSITE]] returns included in a [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] MUST be derived from the returns included in or that will be included in the corresponding [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]].
## Discussion
In the spirit of fair representation and full disclosure, all composite returns included in a GIPS Advertisement must be derived from the returns that have been included in or that will be included in the corresponding GIPS Composite Report. This requirement is to ensure consistency in the performance reported by a firm. If a GIPS Advertisement is more current than the corresponding GIPS Composite Report, it is permissible to include more-recent performance in the GIPS Advertisement, as long as this performance will be included in the GIPS Composite Report when it is updated or would be included in the GIPS Composite Report if it were issued as of the date of the GIPS Advertisement.
