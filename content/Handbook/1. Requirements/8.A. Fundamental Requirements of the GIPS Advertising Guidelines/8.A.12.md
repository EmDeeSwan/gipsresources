# 8.A.12
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM MUST clearly label or identify:
- The name of the [[COMPOSITE]] or [[POOLED FUND]] for which the [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] is prepared.
- The name of any [[BENCHMARK]] included in the [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]].
- The periods that are presented in the [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]].
## Discussion
The items presented in a GIPS Advertisement must be clearly labeled or identified so there is clarity regarding the information being presented. Among the items included in a GIPS Advertisement that must be clearly identified or labeled are:
- the name of the composite or pooled fund for which the GIPS Advertisement is prepared,
- the name of any benchmark included in the GIPS Advertisement, and
- the time periods presented.

The name of the benchmark is particularly important when a customized benchmark is used. Firms may need to include more than the name of a customized benchmark when more information is needed for a reader to understand the information presented. For example, if a firm includes a custom benchmark that is net of model fees and costs, simply stating that the benchmark is a custom benchmark would not allow a reader to understand the benchmark returns. It would be appropriate to disclose that the benchmark is net of fees and costs as well as the fees and costs that were used.
