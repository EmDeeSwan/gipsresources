# 8.A.10
## Standard for Firms
Disclosures included in a [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] for a [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] MUST be consistent with the related disclosure included in the corresponding [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]], unless the disclosure included in the [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] is more current and has not yet been reflected in the corresponding [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]].
## Discussion
In the spirit of fair representation and full disclosure, all disclosures included in a GIPS Advertisement for a limited distribution pooled fund (LDPF) must be consistent with the disclosures included in or that will be included in the corresponding GIPS Pooled Fund Report. This requirement is to ensure consistency in information reported by a firm. If a GIPS Advertisement is more current than the corresponding GIPS Pooled Fund Report, it is permissible to include a more current disclosure in the GIPS Advertisement, as long as the more current disclosure will be included in the GIPS Pooled Fund Report when it is updated or would be included in the GIPS Pooled Fund Report if it were issued as of the date of the GIPS Advertisement.

If the firm does not prepare a GIPS Pooled Fund Report for the LDPF but instead includes the LDPF in a composite for which a GIPS Composite Report is prepared, the disclosures presented in a GIPS Advertisement for the LDPF must be consistent with the related disclosures that would be included in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report if a GIPS Pooled Fund Report for that LDPF were created.
