# 8.A.9
## Standard for Firms
[[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] returns included in a [[GIPS ADVERTISEMENT]] MUST be derived from the returns included in or that will be included in the corresponding [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]].
## Discussion
In the spirit of fair representation and full disclosure, all limited distribution pooled fund (LDPF) returns included in a GIPS Advertisement must be derived from the returns that have been included in or that will be included in the corresponding GIPS Pooled Fund Report. This requirement is to ensure consistency in the performance reported by a firm. If a GIPS Advertisement is more current than the corresponding GIPS Pooled Fund Report, it is permissible to include more-recent performance in the GIPS Advertisement, as long as this performance will be included in the GIPS Pooled Fund Report when it is updated or would be included in the GIPS Pooled Fund Report if it were issued as of the date of the GIPS Advertisement.

If the firm does not prepare a GIPS Pooled Fund Report for the LDPF but instead includes the LDPF in a composite for which a GIPS Composite Report is prepared, the LDPF returns presented in a GIPS Advertisement must be derived from the returns that would be included in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report for that LDPF if a GIPS Pooled Fund Report for that LDPF were created.

(See Provision [[2.A.26]] for information regarding the calculation of time-weighted returns for pooled funds that are not included in composites and Provision [[2.A.29]] for information regarding the calculation of money-weighted returns for pooled funds that are not included in composites.)
