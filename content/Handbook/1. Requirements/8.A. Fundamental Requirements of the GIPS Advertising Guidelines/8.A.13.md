___
# 8.A.13
## Standard for Firms
Other information beyond what is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED under the GIPS Advertising Guidelines (e.g., [[COMPOSITE]] or [[POOLED FUND]] returns for additional periods) MUST be presented with equal or lesser prominence relative to the information REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. This information MUST NOT conflict with the REQUIREMENTS or RECOMMENDATIONS of the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.
## Discussion
A GIPS Advertisement may include information beyond what is required or recommended under the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. For example, returns for periods in addition to the required periods may be shown. However, information beyond what is required or recommended must:
- be shown with equal or lesser prominence relative to the information that is required or recommended,
- not conflict with the requirements or recommendations of the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines,
- not be false or misleading, and
- adhere to the principles of fair representation and full disclosure.

As an example, assume that a GIPS Advertisement for a composite includes all information required by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines in a size 10 font. Including backtested hypothetical performance in size 18 font would not be allowed because this information would not be shown with equal or lesser prominence.
