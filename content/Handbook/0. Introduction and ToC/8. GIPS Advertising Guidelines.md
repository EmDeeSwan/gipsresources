# 8. GIPS Advertising Guidelines
The GIPS Advertising Guidelines provide firms with options for advertising when mentioning the firm’s claim of compliance. The GIPS Advertising Guidelines do not replace the GIPS standards, nor do they absolve firms from presenting GIPS Composite Reports and GIPS Pooled Fund Reports as required by the GIPS standards. These guidelines apply only to firms that already satisfy all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and prepare an advertisement that adheres to the requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines (a “GIPS Advertisement”). Firms may also choose to include a GIPS Composite Report or GIPS Pooled Fund Report in the advertisement.

## Relationship of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines to Regulatory Requirements
When preparing GIPS Advertisements, firms must also adhere to all applicable laws and regulations governing advertisements. Firms are encouraged to seek legal or regulatory counsel because additional disclosures may be required. In cases where applicable laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, firms are required to comply with the laws or regulations.
## Other Information
The GIPS Advertisement may include other information beyond what is required or recommended under the GIPS Advertising Guidelines provided the information is shown with equal or lesser prominence relative to the information required or recommended by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines and the information does not conflict with the requirements or recommendations of the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. Firms must adhere to the principles of fair representation and full disclosure when advertising and must not present performance or performance-related information that is false or misleading.
