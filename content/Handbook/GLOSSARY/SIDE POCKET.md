# SIDE POCKET
A type of account used mainly in alternative investment [[POOLED FUND|POOLED FUNDS]] to separate [[ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS]] or distressed assets from other, more liquid investments or to segregate investments held for a special purpose from other investments. Side pockets are typically not available for investing for new [[POOLED FUND]] investors that invest after the side pocket was created.
