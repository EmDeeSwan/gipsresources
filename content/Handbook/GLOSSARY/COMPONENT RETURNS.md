# COMPONENT RETURNS
## Definition
Component returns separate the total return into a [[CAPITAL RETURN]] and an [[INCOME RETURN]] for [[REAL ESTATE]] [[COMPOSITE|COMPOSITES]], [[REAL ESTATE]] [[POOLED FUND|POOLED FUNDS]], or [[BENCHMARK|BENCHMARKS]]. Component returns provide additional information to prospective clients regarding the sources of the total return and the nature of the investment strategy.
## Calculation
- The following are examples of formulas that may be used to calculate the income return and capital return for a real estate investment. The formulas presented use the following terms:
	- _r<sub>t</sub><sup>GFI</sup>_ = gross-of-fees income return for period
	- _tr<sub>t</sub><sup>NFI</sup>_ = net-of-fees income return for period
	- _tr<sub>t</sub><sup>GFC</sup>_ = gross-of-fees capital return for period
	- _tr<sub>t</sub><sup>NFC</sup>_ = net-of-fees capital return for period
	- _tr<sub>t</sub><sup>GFT</sup>_ = gross-of-fees total return for period _t_
	- _tr<sub>t</sub><sup>NFT</sup>_ = net-of-fees total return for period _t_
	- _NII<sub>t</sub>_ = net investment income (after interest expense, advisory fees, and any performance-based fees allocated to the income component for performance calculation purposes) for period _t_
	- _AF<sub>t</sub>_ = advisory fee (asset-based portion of investment management fee expensed, excluding any performance-based fees) for externally managed segregated accounts for period _t_. AF
	- _PF<sub>t</sub><sup>C</sup>_ = performance-based fees allocated to the capital component (for performance calculation purposes) for externally managed segregated accounts for period _t_. PF
	- _PF<sub>t</sub><sup>I</sup>_ = performance-based fees allocated to the income component (for performance calculation purposes) for externally managed segregated accounts for period _t_. PF
	- _V<sub>t</sub><sup>B</sup>_= the beginning value of the portfolio for period _t_
	- _V<sub>t</sub><sup>E</sup>_ = the ending value of the portfolio for period _t_
	- _j_ = the number of external cash flows (1, 2, 3, . . . , J) in period _t_
	- _CF<sub>j,t</sub>_ = the value of cash flow _j_ in period _t_
	- _W<sub>j,t</sub>_ = the weight of cash flow _j_ in period _t_ (assuming the cash flow occurred at the end of the day) as calculated according to the following formula:

	  where
	  _W<sub>j,t</sub>_ = the weight of cash flow _j_ in period _t_, assuming the cash flow occurred at the end of the day _D<sub>t</sub>_ = the total number of calendar days in period _tD<sub>j,t</sub>_ = the number of calendar days from the beginning of period _t_ to cash flow _j_

Acquisition, disposition, and financing services performed by the firm, an affiliate of the firm, or a third party on a particular transaction are considered transaction costs and must be deducted from both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees returns. These items (also referred to as “brokerage expenses”) are direct costs incurred upon implementation of a particular investment transaction and are considered transaction costs. It is recommended that these transaction costs be accounted for through the capital returns. Please note that the acquisition and disposition transaction costs described earlier are different from investment management fees specifically associated with acquisition and disposition services performed by the firm. It is common practice in the real estate industry to have investment management agreements separate the investment management fee into one or more of the following components: base investment management, acquisition, disposition, and financing. In this scenario, the fees specifically relating to acquisition and disposition are typically considered to be part of the investment management fee because these relate to the investment management responsibilities performed by the firm in formulating its investment decisions as part of the normal investment decision-making process. Financing fees, if applicable, are typically identified separately in the investment management agreement and are classified as transaction costs because they are usually related to post-acquisition refinancing.

The term “net investment income” is intended to reflect the effect of ownership and financing structures and includes all underlying property-level activity. Investment-level returns are distinct from property-level returns. Investment-level returns reflect the effect of ownership and financing structures and include all underlying property-level activity. Property-level returns exclude all of the non-property (investment-level) balance sheet items, as well as income and expenses, and include only those income and expenses that directly relate to the operation of the property. Property-level returns are not used for reporting performance in compliance with the GIPS standards, although they may be shown as supplemental information.

### Income Return
The income return measures the investment income earned on all investments (including cash and cash equivalents) during the measurement period, net of all non-recoverable expenditures, interest expense on debt, and property taxes. The income return is computed as a percentage of the capital employed. Capital employed is defined as the “weighted average equity” (weighted average capital) during the measurement period. Capital employed does not include any income return or capital return earned during the measurement period. Beginning capital is adjusted by weighting the external cash flows that occurred during the period.

The numerator in the gross-of-fees income return represents the investment income for the portfolio during the period, including any income earned during the period at the investment level, and also reflects all income, fees, and expenses at the property level.

The formula for gross-of-fees income return is as follows:

The numerator in the net-of-fees income return represents the net investment income for the portfolio during the period. This figure would include any income earned and expenses and fees deducted at the investment level and all income, fees, and expenses at the property level.

The formula for net-of-fees income return is as follows:

### Capital Return
The capital return is the change in value of the real estate investments and cash and/or cash equivalent assets held throughout the measurement period, adjusted for all capital expenditures (subtracted) and net proceeds from sales (added). The capital return is computed as a percentage of the capital employed. Capital return is also known as “capital appreciation return” or “appreciation return.”

The capital return numerator reflects the change (increase or decrease) in investment value adjusted for capital improvements, sales, refinancing, and net investment income activity.

The numerator includes both realized gains/losses and the change in unrealized gains/losses from the prior period.

The net-of-fees capital return reflects the deduction of any performance-based (incentive) fees attributable to the capital component for performance calculation purposes. This figure would exclude any performance-based fees attributable to the income component for performance calculation purposes.

The formula for gross-of-fees capital return is as follows:

The formula for net-of-fees capital return is as follows:

### Total Return
The total return is the percentage change in value of real estate investments, including all capital return and income return components, expressed as a percentage of the capital employed over the measurement period. The total return numerator measures the change (increase or decrease) in investment value from both income (loss) and realized and unrealized gains and losses.

The formula for total return gross-of-fees is as follows:

The formula for total return net-of-fees is as follows:

All performance results, both total returns and component returns, must be clearly identified so that prospective clients can properly interpret and compare performance. To interpret performance data, prospective clients need to know what the performance results represent.
