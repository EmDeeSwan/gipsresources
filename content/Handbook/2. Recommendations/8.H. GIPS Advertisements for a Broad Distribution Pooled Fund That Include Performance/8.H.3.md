# 8.H.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose how SALES CHARGES AND LOADS are reflected in the POOLED FUND’S returns, if applicable.
## Discussion
In order to help readers of a GIPS Advertisement understand what costs are reflected in a pooled fund’s returns, it is recommended that firms disclose whether or not sales charges and loads are reflected in (i.e., deducted from) the pooled fund’s returns. Sales charges and loads, which are typically charged on the front end or back end, should not be included in the calculation of the pooled fund’s returns, because regulators in some countries do not allow the inclusion of such charges when calculating pooled fund returns. If sales charges and loads have been deducted when calculating the pooled fund’s returns, the deduction of such charges should be disclosed. If sales charges and loads are not reflected in the pooled fund’s returns, it is important that readers understand that purchasing and selling shares of the pooled fund will result in costs that are not reflected in the pooled fund returns presented in the GIPS Advertisement. This recommended disclosure will also help readers in comparing pooled fund returns across funds and firms.

Sales charges and loads may also be referred to as “term commission,” “entry and exit fees,” “frontend,” “back-end,” “differed fees,” “subscription and redemption fees,” “cost of sales/purchase of funds,” “up-front fees,” and “trail commission.”
### Sample Disclosure When the Pooled Fund’s Returns Reflect the Deduction of Sales Charges and Loads:
“The Fund has a maximum entry fee of 5.00% and an exit charge of 1.00%. The pooled fund’s net returns reflect the deduction of both entry and exit fees.”
### Sample Disclosure When the Pooled Fund’s Returns Do Not Reflect the Deduction of Sales Charges and Loads:
“The Fund has sales charges and loads that total 1.50%. Sales charges and loads, which reduce the potential growth of a shareholder’s investment, have not been reflected in the Fund’s net returns presented in this advertisement.”
