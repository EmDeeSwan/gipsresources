# 8.H.1
## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM determines no appropriate [[BENCHMARK]] for the [[POOLED FUND]] exists, the FIRM SHOULD disclose why no [[BENCHMARK]] is presented.
## Discussion
Benchmarks are important tools that aid in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of an investment strategy. They also provide information to the reader of a GIPS Advertisement regarding the relationship between a pooled fund’s risk and return. As a result, the GIPS standards require firms to provide benchmark total returns in all GIPS Advertisements for a broad distribution pooled fund unless the firm determines that no appropriate benchmark for the pooled fund’s strategy exists. The benchmark must reflect the investment mandate, objective, or strategy of the pooled fund. Although there is typically an appropriate benchmark for traditional pooled fund strategies, it is more common for managers of alternative pooled fund strategies to determine that no appropriate benchmark for the pooled fund exists. If this is the case, it is recommended that the firm disclose why no benchmark is presented.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Because the pooled fund’s strategy is absolute return where investments are permitted in all asset classes, no benchmark is presented because we believe that no benchmark that reflects this strategy exists.”
