# 8.H.2
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose the [[POOLED FUND|POOLED FUND’S]] SALES CHARGES AND LOADS.
## Discussion
In order for the reader of the GIPS Advertisement to have a clear understanding of the costs of buying or selling shares in a broad distribution pooled fund, it is recommended that firms disclose the pooled fund’s sales charges and loads. This information may be an important factor in a reader’s decision as to whether or not to buy shares of a particular fund.

Sales charges and loads may also be referred to as “term commission,” “entry and exit fees,” “frontend,” “back-end,” “deferred fees,” “subscription and redemption fees,” “cost of sales/purchase of funds,” “up-front fees,” and “trail commission.”
### Sample Disclosures:
“The Fund has a maximum entry fee of 5.00% and an exit charge of 1.00%. In some cases, an investor might pay less. Please refer to your financial advisor or distributor for the actual entry and exit changes.”

“The sales charge (load) imposed on purchases, as well as the sales charge (load) on reinvested distributions is 3.00%. There are no distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees.”
