## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD provide to each current client, on an annual basis, a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] of the [[COMPOSITE]] in which the client’s PORTFOLIO is included.
## Discussion
It is recommended, but not required, that a firm provide a GIPS Composite Report to a current client on an annual basis. It is likely to be helpful for a client to know how the client’s own portfolio performed relative to other portfolios that are managed according to the same investment objective, mandate, or strategy. In addition to composite performance, GIPS Composite Reports include important disclosures and presentation items that a firm may not provide to current clients as part of client reporting. These disclosures and presentation items will likely provide useful information to current clients in their periodic assessment of the firm.
