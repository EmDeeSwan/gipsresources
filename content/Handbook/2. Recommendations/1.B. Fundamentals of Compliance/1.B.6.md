## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD provide to each [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] current investor, on an annual basis, a [[GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT]] of the [[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION POOLED FUND]] in which the investor is invested.
## Discussion
It is recommended, but not required, that a firm provide a GIPS Pooled Fund Report to a current investor in a limited distribution pooled fund (LDPF) on an annual basis. In addition to fund performance, GIPS Pooled Fund Reports include important disclosures and presentation items that a firm might not provide to current investors as a part of investor reporting. These disclosures and presentation items will likely provide useful information to current investors in their periodic assessment of the pooled fund. If the firm includes the LDPF in a composite, the firm may instead provide the GIPS Composite Report for the composite in which the fund is included.
