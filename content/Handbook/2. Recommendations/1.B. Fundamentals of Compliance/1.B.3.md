## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD be verified.
## Discussion
[[VERIFICATION]] is intended to provide a firm and its current and prospective clients and pooled fund investors additional confidence in the firm’s claim of compliance with the GIPS standards. It is recommended that firms be verified for all period(s) for which compliance with the GIPS standards is claimed. Verification may increase the knowledge of the firm’s performance measurement team and improve the consistency and quality of the firm’s GIPS standards-related performance information. Verification may also result in improved internal policies and procedures as well as marketing advantages to the firm. Verification does not provide assurance, however, about the performance of any specific composite or pooled fund or the accuracy of any specific GIPS Report. Although verification brings additional credibility to the claim of compliance, it does not provide assurance on the firm’s claim of compliance with the GIPS standards in its entirety.
