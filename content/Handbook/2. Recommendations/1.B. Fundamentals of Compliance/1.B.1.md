# 1.B.1
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD comply with the RECOMMENDATIONS of the GIPS standards, including RECOMMENDATIONS in any Guidance Statements, interpretations, and Q&As published by CFA Institute and the GIPS standards governing bodies.
## Discussion
The recommendations contained in the GIPS standards are suggested tasks or actions that are considered best practice and should be followed or performed, although they are not required.

The GIPS standards must be applied with the objectives of fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance. However, meeting the objectives of fair representation and full disclosure, which are the fundamental principles of the GIPS standards, may mean that a firm must follow the recommendations in addition to the requirements of the GIPS standards. If a firm chooses to adopt any recommendations, its policies and procedures must reflect how that recommendation is applied.
