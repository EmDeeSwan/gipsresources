# 2.B.2
## Standard for Firms
Valuations SHOULD be obtained from a qualified independent third party.
## Discussion
The quality of valuations used as inputs to calculate performance has a significant effect on the accuracy of portfolio and composite returns; therefore, it is important that the valuations used are accurate. It is recommended that firms obtain valuations from an independent source because a third party can provide the most objective investment valuations. In most instances, obtaining valuations from an independent third party is considered to be a best practice. A firm claiming compliance with the GIPS standards is responsible for its claim of compliance and must ensure that the valuations obtained from a third party can be used to satisfy the requirements of the GIPS standards.
