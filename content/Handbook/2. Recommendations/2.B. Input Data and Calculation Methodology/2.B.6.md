# 2.B.6
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD incorporate the following hierarchy into its policies and procedures for determining FAIR VALUE for PORTFOLIO investments on a [[COMPOSITE]]-specific or POOLED FUND-specific basis.

- Investments MUST be valued using objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date, if available. If such prices are not available, then investments SHOULD be valued using;
- Objective, observable quoted market prices for similar investments in active markets. If such prices are not available or appropriate, then investments SHOULD be valued using;
- Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active (markets in which there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially over time and/or between market makers). If such prices are not available or appropriate, then investments SHOULD be valued based on;
- Market-based inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the investment. If such inputs are not available or appropriate, then investments SHOULD be valued based on;
- Subjective, unobservable inputs for the investment where markets are not active at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs SHOULD be used to measure FAIR VALUE only when observable inputs and prices are not available or appropriate. Unobservable inputs reflect the FIRM’S own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investment and SHOULD be developed based on the best information available under the circumstances.
## Discussion
The GIPS standards include a recommended valuation hierarchy as presented in Provision 2.B.6. It is recommended that firms incorporate this hierarchy into their policies for determining fair value for portfolio investments on a composite-specific or pooled fund-specific basis. For further information regarding fair valuation and the frequency of internal and external valuation requirements, please refer to Provision [[2.A.19]].
