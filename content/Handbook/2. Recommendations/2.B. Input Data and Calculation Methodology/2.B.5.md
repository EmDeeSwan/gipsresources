## Standard for Firms
Returns SHOULD be calculated net of non-reclaimable withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Reclaimable withholding taxes SHOULD be accrued.
## Discussion
Global investing requires recognition of the tax consequences of investing in different countries. The GIPS standards recommend that performance be reported net of non-reclaimable withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Some countries allow certain types of foreign investors to reclaim a portion of the foreign withholding taxes that are paid. These reclaimable foreign withholding taxes may be credited back to the investor at a later date. It is recommended that reclaimable foreign withholding taxes be accrued, meaning that the refund for reclaimable withholding taxes should be recorded when the reclaimable withholding taxes become a receivable owed to the firm, rather than when the refund is actually received.
