## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD accrue [[INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE|INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES]].
## Discussion
Investment management fees are the fees payable to the investment management firm for the ongoing management of a portfolio. They are typically asset based (based on a percentage of assets), performance based (based on the portfolioâ€™s performance either on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark), or a combination of the two, but they may take other forms as well. Investment management fees also include carried interest.

To calculate a net-of-fees return for a portfolio or composite, the gross-of-fees return must be reduced by investment management fees. To calculate a pooled fund net return, the pooled fund gross return must be reduced by investment management fees as well as by administrative fees and other costs. To reflect the most accurate net-of-fees return, investment management fees should be accrued when possible. Accrual accounting allows the recording of financial transactions as they come into existence rather when they are paid or settled. Net-of-fees returns can be skewed if investment management fees are reflected in the calculation as they are paid, particularly when portfolio values change significantly.
