# 2.B.7
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD USE [[GROSS-OF-FEES]] returns when calculating risk measures.
## Discussion
Acknowledging that there are many acceptable calculation variations for various risk measures, the GIPS standards do not prescribe a specific methodology for calculating risk measures. It is recommended, however, that gross-of-fees returns be used when calculating risk measures. It is recommended that firms use gross-of-fees returns because these are not affected by investment management fees, which may introduce additional variability of returns.

Firms are required to select a calculation methodology, on a composite-specific or pooled fund-specific basis, for each risk measure presented in a GIPS Report. They must document the chosen calculation methodology in their policies and procedures, and then consistently apply the methodology selected.
