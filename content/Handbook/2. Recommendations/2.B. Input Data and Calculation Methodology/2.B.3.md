## Standard for Firms
[[ACCRUAL ACCOUNTING]] SHOULD be used for dividends (as of the ex-dividend date).
## Discussion
Accrual accounting determines the correct economic value of the portfolio assets and allows the recording of financial transactions as they come into existence rather than when they are paid or settled. It is recommended that dividends be recognized when earned on ex-date (accrual basis) versus when paid (cash basis).
