## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD value PORTFOLIOS on the date of all [[EXTERNAL CASH FLOW|EXTERNAL CASH FLOWS]].
## Discussion
To improve the accuracy of time-weighted performance calculations, the GIPS standards have gradually increased the minimum required frequency of portfolio valuation for many portfolio types from quarterly, to monthly, to the date of all large cash flows for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010. Best practice, however, is to value portfolios on the date of all external cash flows. Firms are encouraged to create a policy to value portfolios on the date of all external cash flows as part of the composite-specific valuation policy where possible.
