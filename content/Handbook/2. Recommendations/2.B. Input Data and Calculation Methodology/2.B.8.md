## Standard for Firms
PRIVATE MARKET INVESTMENTS SHOULD have an [[EXTERNAL VALUATION]] at least once every 12 months.
## Discussion
For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020, it is recommended that private market investments have an external valuation at least once every 12 months. (This is a requirement for real estate investments in a real estate open-end fund. Real estate investments not in a real estate open-end fund must have an external valuation at least once every 12 months, unless client agreements stipulate a less frequent external valuation, or be subject to an annual financial statement audit. See Provisions [[2.A.43]] and [[2.A.44]].)

Those evaluating a firm’s private market investments, including prospective clients or investors, typically prefer an external valuation because it is independent, unbiased, and an “expert” estimate of value that is perceived by the marketplace to be more reliable than an internal valuation.

An external valuation is an assessment of value performed by an independent third party who is a professionally designated or certified commercial property valuer or appraiser. In markets where these professionals are unavailable, steps must be taken to ensure that only qualified independent property valuers or appraisers are used. For additional information regarding an external valuation, please refer to Provision [[2.A.45]].
