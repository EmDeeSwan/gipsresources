# 6.B.6
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present more than 10 years of annual performance in the GIPS POOLED FUND REPORT.
## Discussion
Once the pooled fund has its initial minimum 5-year (or since-inception) compliant history, the firm must continue to add annual returns to each GIPS Pooled Fund Report for the next 5 years, at a minimum, so that the firm will build up to a 10-year compliant performance record for its pooled funds.

At some point, a firm will have a minimum 10-year compliant track record for a specific pooled fund. When the firm eventually adds an additional annual return to a 10-year track record in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report, the firm may delete the information for the oldest year included or may instead present a longer track record. It is recommended that firms include more than the minimum 10 years of annual performance in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report to provide more information to prospective investors. If any performance is presented that does not comply with the GIPS standards (only allowed for periods prior to 1 January 2006 for real estate and private equity pooled funds and prior to 1 January 2000 for all other pooled funds), firms must disclose the period(s) of non-compliance.
