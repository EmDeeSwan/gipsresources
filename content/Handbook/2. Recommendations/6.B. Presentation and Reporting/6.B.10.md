Links: [[6. Pooled Fund Time-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 6.B.10
## Standard for Firms
For POOLED FUNDS OF FUNDS, the FIRM SHOULD present the percentage, if any, of [[POOLED FUND]] assets that is invested in [[DIRECT INVESTMENTS]] (rather than in fund investment vehicles) as of each annual period end.
## Discussion
Direct investments by a fund of funds are investments made directly in companies rather than investments made through pooled funds. Direct investments may augment the strategy used in the investment in underlying pooled funds. Direct investments may have different terms and conditions that might change the return characteristics of the fund of funds, such as a different fee structure. By presenting the percentage of investments dedicated to direct investments as of each annual period end, the firm is providing additional transparency and allowing the prospective investor to factor in additional criteria when analyzing the returns included in the GIPS Pooled Fund Report for the fund of funds. If no assets are invested in direct investments, this recommendation is not applicable.
