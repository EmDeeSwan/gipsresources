## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present the following items:
- Annualized [[POOLED FUND]] and BENCHMARK returns for periods longer than 12 months.
## Discussion
It is recommended that firms show the results of both the pooled fund and the benchmark for periods longer than 12 months in annualized terms to help prospective investors evaluate the pooled fund’s track record. Annualized returns are created by calculating the geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean, and represent the geometric average annual compound return achieved over the defined period of more than one year. Sub-period returns during the investment period are geometrically linked to calculate the cumulative return. Then the *n*th root of the cumulative return is calculated, where _n_ is the number of years in the period. Annualized performance is permitted only for periods of one year or more.

The formula for calculating annualized performance is as follows:

For example, assume a pooled fund’s cumulative return for a five-year period is 150.0%. It has a five-year average annual compound return, or annualized return, of 20.11%, calculated as:

If instead the 150% is achieved over 12.5 years, the 12.5-year average annual compound return, or annualized return, is 7.61%, calculated as:
