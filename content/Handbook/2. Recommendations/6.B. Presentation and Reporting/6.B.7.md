___
# 6.B.7
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present PROPRIETARY ASSETS as a percentage of [[POOLED FUND]] assets as of each annual period end.
## Discussion
Proprietary assets are assets owned by the firm, the firm’s management, and/or the firm’s parent company that are managed by the firm. Knowing how much of a pooled fund’s assets are proprietary and how much are managed for external investors provides prospective investors with additional insight regarding the pooled fund, especially when a significant percentage of the pooled fund’s assets are proprietary assets. If a pooled fund includes proprietary assets, it is recommended that firms present proprietary assets as a percentage of pooled fund assets as of each annual period end.
