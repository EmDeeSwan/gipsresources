# 6.B.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present the following items:
- Quarterly and/or monthly returns.
## Discussion
Although the GIPS standards require the presentation of annual returns for the pooled fund and benchmark (Provisions [[6.A.1.b]] and [[6.A.1.e]]), it is recommended that firms present more-frequent returns, such as quarterly or monthly returns. More-frequent returns help prospective investors evaluate a pooled fund’s track record. Firms must present benchmark returns for the same periods for which pooled fund returns are presented. If the GIPS Pooled Fund Report includes annual and quarterly pooled fund returns, annual and quarterly benchmark returns must also be presented.
