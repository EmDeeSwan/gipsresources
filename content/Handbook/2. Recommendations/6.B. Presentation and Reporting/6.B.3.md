## Standard for Firms
For all periods for which an annualized EX POST STANDARD DEVIATION of the POOLED FUND and the BENCHMARK are presented, the FIRM SHOULD present the corresponding annualized return of the POOLED FUND and the BENCHMARK.
## Discussion
To provide context so that the prospective investor can better understand the ex post standard deviation, it is recommended that firms present annualized returns for the pooled fund and benchmark for the same periods for which annualized standard deviation is presented. For example, if a firm chooses to present the 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year annualized standard deviations in addition to the required 3-year annualized standard deviation, firms are encouraged to also present the corresponding 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year annualized returns for the pooled fund and the benchmark. Doing so will help prospective investors to better interpret risk and return in the context of the return distribution for all periods for which an annualized standard deviation is presented.
