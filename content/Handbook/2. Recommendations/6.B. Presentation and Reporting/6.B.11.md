## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM has [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]], the FIRM SHOULD present FIRM-wide uncalled [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]] as of each annual period end.
## Discussion
Committed capital is defined as pledges of capital to an investment vehicle by investors (limited partners and the general partner) or the firm and is typically drawn down over a period of time.

Uncalled committed capital, also known as dry powder, is the amount of capital that has not yet been drawn. If a firm has committed capital, it is recommended that the firm present total firm-wide uncalled committed capital as of each annual period end. This information provides prospective investors a more complete picture of the capital that is currently committed to a future investment. If the firm chooses to present firm-wide uncalled committed capital, it may present this amount separately from total firm assets. The firm may also choose to present the combination of total firm assets and firm-wide uncalled committed capital. Provision [[6.A.7]] discusses the requirements relating to the presentation of firm-wide uncalled committed capital in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report.
