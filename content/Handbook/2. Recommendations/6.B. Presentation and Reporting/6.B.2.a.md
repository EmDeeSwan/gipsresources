# 6.B.2
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present the following items:
- Cumulative returns of the [[POOLED FUND]] and the BENCHMARK for all periods.
## Discussion
Cumulative returns of the pooled fund and benchmark provide additional useful information to prospective investors by indicating the total rate of return for a defined period of performance. It is therefore recommended that cumulative returns for all periods be provided in addition to the required annual returns.

To calculate cumulative returns of a pooled fund for any period, the historical daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual sub-period returns are geometrically linked according to the following formula:

where R1 is the pooled fund return for Period 1 and Rn is the pooled fund return for the most recent period.

### Example:
Firm ABC has the following annual returns that were calculated from monthly pooled fund returns:

||Pooled Fund|1 + R_n_|
|---|---|---|
|2015|2.3%|1.023|
|2016|-4.7%|0.953|
|2017|6.9%|1.069|
|2018|3.2%|1.032|
|20190.9%|0.9%|1.009|
|Jan 2020-Jun 2020|-3.1%|0.969|

To calculate the pooled fund cumulative return for the period from January 2015 through June 2020, the returns are linked:
