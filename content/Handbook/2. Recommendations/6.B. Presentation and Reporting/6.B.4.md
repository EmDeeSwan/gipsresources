## Standard for Firms
For all periods greater than three years for which an annualized return of the [[POOLED FUND]] and the BENCHMARK are presented, the FIRM SHOULD present the corresponding annualized [[EX POST]] STANDARD DEVIATION (using monthly returns) of the [[POOLED FUND]] and the BENCHMARK.
## Discussion
To provide context so that the prospective investor can interpret the annualized pooled fund and benchmark returns, it is recommended that firms present the annualized ex post standard deviation (using monthly returns) for both the pooled fund and benchmark for the same periods that annualized pooled fund and benchmark returns are presented. For example, if a firm chooses to present the 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year annualized pooled fund and benchmark returns, firms are encouraged to also present the corresponding 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year annualized ex post standard deviations of the pooled fund and benchmark. Doing so will help prospective investors to assess and compare risk and return for all periods for which annualized returns are presented.
