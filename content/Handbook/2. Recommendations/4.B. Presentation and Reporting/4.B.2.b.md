## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present the following items:
- Equal-weighted [[COMPOSITE]] returns.
## Discussion
The GIPS standards require that composite time-weighted returns be calculated by asset-weighting the individual portfolio returns or by using the aggregate method. (See Provision [[2.A.36]].) This allows for a larger portfolio to have more weight on a composite’s return than a smaller portfolio. Equal-weighted composite returns, however, provide another useful perspective on composite performance. The simple average, together with a measure of internal dispersion, provides a measure of the manager’s ability to obtain consistent returns for all portfolios regardless of size. It is therefore recommended that firms also include equal-weighted composite returns in a GIPS Composite Report.
