# 4.B.2.d
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present the following items:
- Annualized [[COMPOSITE]] and BENCHMARK returns for periods longer than 12 months.
## Discussion
It is recommended that firms show the results of both the composite and the benchmark for periods longer than 12 months in annualized terms to help prospective clients in the evaluation of the compositeâ€™s track record. Annualized returns are created by calculating the geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean, and represent the geometric average annual compound return achieved over the defined period of more than one year. Sub-period returns during the investment period are geometrically linked to calculate the cumulative return. Then the _n_ th root of the cumulative return is calculated, where _n_ is the number of years in the period. Annualized performance is permitted only for periods of one year or more.
