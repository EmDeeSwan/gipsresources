# 4.B.2.c
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present the following items:
- Quarterly and/or monthly returns.
## Discussion
Although the GIPS standards require the presentation of annual returns for the composite and benchmark (Provisions [[4.A.1.b]] and [[4.A.1.e]]), it is recommended that firms present more-frequent returns, such as quarterly or monthly returns. More-frequent returns help prospective clients evaluate a compositeâ€™s track record. Firms must present benchmark returns for the same periods for which composite returns are presented. If the GIPS Composite Report includes annual and quarterly composite returns, annual and quarterly benchmark returns must also be presented.
