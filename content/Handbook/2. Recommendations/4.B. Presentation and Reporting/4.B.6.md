# 4.B.6
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present more than 10 years of annual performance in the GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT.
## Discussion
Once the composite has its initial minimum 5-year (or since-inception) compliant history, the firm must continue to add annual returns to each GIPS Composite Report for the next 5 years, at a minimum, so that the firm will build up to a 10-year compliant performance record for its composites.

At some point, a firm will have a minimum 10-year compliant track record for a specific composite. When the firm eventually adds an additional annual return to a 10-year track record in a GIPS Composite Report, the firm may delete the information for the oldest year included or may instead present a longer track record. It is recommended that firms include more than the minimum 10 years of annual performance in a GIPS Composite Report to provide more information to prospective clients. If any performance is presented that does not comply with the GIPS standards (only allowed for periods prior to 1 January 2006 for wrap fee, real estate, and private equity composites and prior to 1 January 2000 for all other composites), firms must disclose the period(s) of non-compliance.
