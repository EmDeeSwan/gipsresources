## Standard for Firms
For all periods greater than three years for which an annualized return of the [[COMPOSITE]] and the BENCHMARK are presented, the FIRM SHOULD present the corresponding annualized EX POST STANDARD DEVIATION (using monthly returns) of the [[COMPOSITE]] and the BENCHMARK.
## Discussion
To provide context so that the prospective client can interpret the annualized composite and benchmark returns, it is recommended that firms present the annualized ex post standard deviation (using monthly returns) for both the composite and benchmark for the same periods that annualized composite and benchmark returns are presented. For example, if a firm chooses to present the 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year annualized composite and benchmark returns, firms are encouraged to also present the corresponding 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year annualized ex post standard deviation of the composite and benchmark. This will help prospective clients to assess and compare risk and return for all periods for which annualized returns are presented.
