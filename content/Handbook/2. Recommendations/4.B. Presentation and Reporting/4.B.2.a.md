Links: [[4. Composite Time-Weighted Return Report]], [[4.B.2]]
___
# 4.B.2.a
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present the following items:
- Cumulative returns of the [[COMPOSITE]] and the BENCHMARK for all periods.
## Discussion
Cumulative returns of the composite and benchmark provide additional useful information to prospective clients by indicating the total rate of return for a defined period of performance. It is therefore recommended that cumulative returns for all periods be provided in addition to the required annual returns.

To calculate cumulative returns of a composite for any period, the historical daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual sub-period returns are geometrically linked according to the following formula:

R<sub>CUM</sub> = ((1+R<sub>1</sub>)x(1+R<sub>2</sub>)xâ€¦x(1+R<sub>n</sub>)) -1

where _R<sub>1</sub>_ is the composite return for Period 1 and _R<sub>n</sub>_ is the composite return for the most recent period.

Example:
Firm ABC has the following annual returns that were calculated from monthly composite returns:

|                   | Composite | 1 + R<sub>n</sub> |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 2015              | 2.30%     | 1.023             |
| 2016              | -4.70%    | 0.953             |
| 2017              | 6.90%     | 1.069             |
| 2018              | 3.20%     | 1.032             |
| 2019              | 0.90%     | 1.009             |
| Jan 2020-Jun 2020 | -3.10%    | 0.969             |

To calculate the composite cumulative return for the period from January 2015 through June 2020, the returns are linked:

Composite cumulative return =((1.023)x(0.953)x(1.069)x(1.032)x(1.009)x(0.969)) - 1 = 0.052, or 5.2%.

If the composite experiences a break in the track record, the periods before and after the break must not be linked. Therefore, in such a case, a cumulative return may be calculated up to the break and a separate cumulative return may be calculated for the performance period that begins after the break. However, the firm must not calculate a cumulative return across the periods that include the break. Additional guidance on how to calculate performance if there is a break in the track record is included in the discussion of Provision [[4.A.5]].
