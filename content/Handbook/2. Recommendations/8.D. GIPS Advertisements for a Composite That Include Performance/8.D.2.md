# 8.D.2
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose how leverage, derivatives, and short positions have been used historically, if material.
## Discussion
It is recommended that firms provide enough information in a GIPS Advertisement to allow a reader to understand how leverage, derivatives, and short positions have been employed historically and may be used going forward. Although the recommended disclosure of the composite description (Provision [[8.D.1]]) would include disclosure of the firm’s ability to use leverage, derivatives, and short positions, Provision [[8.D.2]] recommends that the firm disclose how leverage, derivatives, and short positions have been used historically, if material. Taken together, these two recommended disclosures provide a more complete picture of the presence, use, and extent of leverage, derivatives, and short positions.

For example, assume a firm discloses in the composite description that the strategy may employ up to 200% leverage. To satisfy the disclosure recommendation in Provision [[8.D.2]], the firm might state, “Since the inception of the strategy, the leverage has averaged 110% of the composite’s value; during 2019, however, the leverage averaged 160%, which greatly increased the sensitivity to market volatility and the potential for realized gains and/or losses.”

When determining what would be material, the firm must consider whether the disclosure of how leverage, derivatives, and/or short positions have been used historically is likely to affect a reader’s view of the risk involved in the strategy. If so, the firm must consider if it would be misleading to fail to disclose their use when describing the strategy.
