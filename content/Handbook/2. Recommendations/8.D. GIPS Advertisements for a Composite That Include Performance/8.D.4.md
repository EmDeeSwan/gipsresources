___
# 8.D.4
## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM determines no appropriate [[BENCHMARK]] for the [[COMPOSITE]] exists, the FIRM SHOULD disclose why no [[BENCHMARK]] is presented.
## Discussion
Benchmarks are important tools that aid in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of an investment strategy. They also provide information to the reader of a GIPS Advertisement regarding the relationship between a composite’s risk and return. As a result, the GIPS standards require firms to provide benchmark total returns in all GIPS Advertisements, unless the firm determines that no appropriate benchmark for the composite exists. The benchmark must reflect the investment mandate, objective, or strategy of the composite. Although there is typically an appropriate benchmark for traditional strategies, it is more common for managers of alternative strategies to determine that no appropriate benchmark for the composite exists. If this is the case, it is recommended that the firm disclose why no benchmark is presented.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Because the composite’s strategy is absolute return where investments are permitted in all asset classes, as a result no benchmark is presented because we believe that no benchmark that reflects this strategy exists.”
