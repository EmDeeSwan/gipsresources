___
# 4.D.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose material differences between the BENCHMARK and the COMPOSITE’S investment mandate, objective, or strategy.
## Discussion
Firms are required to disclose the composite description (see Provision 4.C.4) and the benchmark description (see Provision [[4.C.5]]) in a GIPS Composite Report. It is recommended that firms also disclose any material differences between the benchmark and the composite’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Prospective clients will be better able to evaluate the performance of the strategy relative to the benchmark presented if they understand any material differences between the composite and the benchmark.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The Concentrated Equity Composite invests in only the top 20 stocks (as determined by the firm’s Investment Committee) of the stocks that are included in its benchmark, the XYZ Index.”
