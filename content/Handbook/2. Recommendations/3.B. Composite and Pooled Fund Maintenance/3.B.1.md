# 3.B.1
## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM sets a minimum asset level for PORTFOLIOS to be included in a [[COMPOSITE]], the FIRM SHOULD NOT present a [[GIPS COMPOSITE REPORT]] to a PROSPECTIVE CLIENT known not to meet the COMPOSITE’S minimum asset level.
## Discussion
When a firm establishes a minimum asset level for including portfolios in a composite, the firm is indicating that portfolios below that level are too small to be representative of that strategy. In the spirit of fair representation, it would not be in the prospective client’s best interest to be shown a GIPS Composite Report for a composite with a strategy that is not available to the prospective client. (See Provision [[3.A.11]] for a discussion of a composite minimum asset level.)
