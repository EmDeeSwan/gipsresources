## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose material changes to valuation policies and/or methodologies.
## Discussion
Valuation is a critical component of the performance calculation. Therefore, if a change to a firm’s valuation policies and/or methodologies is material, firms should disclose the change in order to enable prospective investors to understand the potential effect of such a change. Some examples of a material change include, but are not limited to, the following:
- new valuation principles adopted by a local accounting standards board,
- adoption of new international standards in lieu of local standards,
- change of economic criteria used to value investments, and
- change from a discounted cash flow basis to a comparables basis.
### Sample Disclosure for a Policy Change:
“Prior to 1 March 2016, illiquid securities were valued internally. Subsequently, illiquid securities are valued using a third-party pricing service.”
### Sample Disclosure for a Methodology Change:
“For periods prior to 1 August 2019, real estate investments were valued on a discounted cash flow basis. As of 1 August 2019, real estate investments are valued on a comparables basis.”
