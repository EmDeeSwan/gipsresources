## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM adheres to any industry valuation guidelines in addition to the GIPS valuation REQUIREMENTS, the FIRM SHOULD disclose which guidelines have been applied.
## Discussion
Some market segments, such as private equity, have developed their own valuation guidelines. For these markets, it is not uncommon for the GIPS standards valuation requirements to be supplemented by other local or international standards because other standards may be more stringent in their requirements.

The disclosure of which industry’s valuation guidelines have been used in addition to the GIPS standards valuation requirements will help prospective investors to determine the comparability of GIPS Pooled Fund Reports from different firms and/or jurisdictions.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The Global Diversified Distressed Fund adheres to the XYZ Venture Capital Association’s valuation guidelines as well as the GIPS standards valuation requirements. The XYZ valuation standards are based on fair value but provide more prescriptive advice in terms of how to value specific investments, such as secondary investments and distressed debt investments.”
