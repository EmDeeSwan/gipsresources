# 6.D.4
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose the key assumptions used to value investments.
## Discussion
Firms are required to disclose that valuation policies are available upon request. (See Provision [[6.C.14]]) Because valuation is a critical component of the performance calculation, it is recommended that firms also disclose the key assumptions used when valuing pooled fund investments. This will help prospective investors better understand how the firm values investments and compare valuation assumptions for similar strategies used by different firms.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Investments are valued using recent market quotations. If there is no publicly traded reference, equity investments are valued using a market multiples approach for similar investments in active markets, and fixed-income investments are valued using inputs such as interest rates, yield curve shape, volatility, prepayments, and credit risk.”
