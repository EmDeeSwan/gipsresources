# 6.D.2
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose material changes to calculation policies and/or methodologies.
## Discussion
Firms have discretion to determine which policies and methodologies are used for calculating performance. Although these policies and methodologies must adhere to all applicable calculation requirements, firms may choose from a wide variety of policies and methodologies. Firms may change calculation policies and/or methodologies; however, firms must not change a calculation policy or methodology for the sole purpose of increasing performance. If a change to the calculation policies and/or methodologies is material, firms should disclose the change in order to enable prospective investors to understand the potential effect of such a change.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Effective 1 January 2010, fund returns are calculated daily, using a true time-weighted return methodology. Previously, fund returns were calculated monthly using the Modified Dietz method.”
