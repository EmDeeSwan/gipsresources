# 6.D.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose material differences between the BENCHMARK and the POOLED FUND’S investment mandate, objective, or strategy.
## Discussion
Firms are required to disclose the pooled fund description (see Provision [[6.C.4]]) and the benchmark description (see Provision [[6.C.5]]) in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report. It is recommended that firms also disclose any material differences between the benchmark and the pooled fund’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Prospective investors will be better able to evaluate the performance of the strategy relative to the benchmark presented if they understand any material differences between the pooled fund and the benchmark.
### Sample Disclosures:
“The Concentrated Equity Pooled Fund focuses its investments on the health care and technology sectors. As of 31 December 2019, 62% of the Fund was invested in the health care and technology sectors, while 18% of the fund’s benchmark, the XYZ Index, was invested in these two sectors.”

“The Absolute Return Pooled Fund invests in stocks both long and short regardless of country of domicile or market capitalization. The Fund’s benchmark is the T-bill rate, which is the hurdle rate, and is composed of materially different investments.”
