# 6.D.8
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose how research costs are reflected in returns.
## Discussion
The focus on research costs has grown in certain markets. Although research costs are often absorbed by the firm, some firms instead charge research costs directly to investors. To allow prospective investors to understand the firm’s policy for the treatment of research costs, firms should disclose if returns do or do not reflect the deduction of research costs.
### Sample Disclosures:
“ABC Company bears the costs of investment research. Research costs are not separately charged to investors or to the fund.”

“Certain investment research costs are charged directly to investors and are not paid by pooled fund assets. Therefore, fund returns do not reflect the research costs that are charged directly to investors.”
