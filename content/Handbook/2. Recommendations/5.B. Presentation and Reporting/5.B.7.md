## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM has [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]], the FIRM SHOULD present FIRM-wide uncalled [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]] as of the most recent annual period end.
## Discussion
Committed capital is defined as pledges of capital to an investment vehicle by investors (limited partners and the general partner) or the firm and is typically drawn down over a period of time.

Uncalled committed capital, also known as dry powder, is the amount of capital that has not yet been drawn. If a firm has committed capital, it is recommended that the firm present total firmwide uncalled committed capital as of the most recent annual period end. This information provides prospective clients a more complete picture of the capital that is currently committed to a future investment. If the firm chooses to present firm-wide uncalled committed capital, it may present this amount separately from total firm assets. The firm may also choose to present the combination of total firm assets and firmwide uncalled committed capital. Provision [[5.A.10]] discusses the requirements relating to the presentation of firm-wide uncalled committed capital in a GIPS Composite Report.
