Links: [[5. Composite Money-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 5.B.1
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present annualized [[SINCE-INCEPTION]] [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN|MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURNS]] as of each annual period end.
## Discussion
Although a firm is required to present only the annualized composite since-inception money-weighed return (SI-MWR) through the most recent annual period end, it is recommended that the firm also present SI-MWRs as of each annual period end. Doing so will provide prospective clients with a more complete picture of the performance of the composite over time.
