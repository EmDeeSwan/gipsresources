## Standard for Firms
If the FIRM uses preliminary, estimated values as [[FAIR VALUE]], the FIRM SHOULD present the percentage of assets in the [[COMPOSITE]] that were valued using preliminary, estimated values as of the most recent annual period end.
## Discussion
The use of preliminary, estimated values as fair value is common for some alternative strategies, including those that invest in underlying funds for which the firm relies on valuations provided by the underlying fund managers. When using preliminary, estimated values as fair value, it is important to remember the underlying principles of the GIPS standards: fair representation and full disclosure. If using preliminary, estimated values, firms must disclose this fact in the relevant GIPS Composite Report (see Provision [[5.C.39]]). It is recommended that the firm also present the percentage of assets in the composite that were valued using preliminary, estimated values as of the most recent annual period end. This provides important information that allows prospective clients to better assess the valuations and performance record presented.
