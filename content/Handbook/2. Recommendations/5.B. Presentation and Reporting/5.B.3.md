___
# 5.B.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present both annualized [[GROSS-OF-FEES]] and NET-OF-FEES [[COMPOSITE]] [[SINCE-INCEPTION]] [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN|MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURNS]].
## Discussion
A firm is required to present either an annualized gross-of-fees or net-of-fees composite since-inception money-weighted return (SI-MWR) in a GIPS Composite Report that presents money-weighed returns. Each type of return provides important information to prospective clients.

Because a gross-of-fees composite SI-MWR is the return on investments reduced by any transaction costs, it is the best measure of the firm’s investment management ability and can be thought of as the “investment return.” In addition, because fees are sometimes negotiable, presenting gross-of-fees SI-MWRs shows the firm’s expertise in managing assets without the effect of the firm’s or client’s negotiating skills. Gross-of-fees returns also allow prospective clients to better compare performance between firms.

Net-of-fees composite SI-MWRs reflect the deduction of transaction costs and investment management fees. Net-of-fees composite returns therefore provide the best indication to prospective clients of the returns that the firm’s clients received or would have received over time, after taking into account the effect of investment management costs.

Because both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees composite SI-MWRs provide important information to prospective clients, it is recommended that firms present both gross-of-fees and net-of-fees composite SI-MWRs in a GIPS Composite Report.
