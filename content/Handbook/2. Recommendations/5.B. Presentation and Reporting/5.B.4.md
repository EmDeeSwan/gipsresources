# 5.B.4
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD present PROPRIETARY ASSETS as a percentage of [[COMPOSITE]] assets as of the most recent annual period end.
## Discussion
Proprietary assets are assets owned by the firm, the firm’s management, and/or the firm’s parent company that are managed by the firm. Knowing how much of a composite’s assets are proprietary and how much are managed for external clients provides prospective clients with additional insight regarding the composite, especially when a significant percentage of the composite’s assets are proprietary assets. If a composite includes proprietary assets, it is recommended that firms present proprietary assets as a percentage of composite assets as of the most recent annual period end.
