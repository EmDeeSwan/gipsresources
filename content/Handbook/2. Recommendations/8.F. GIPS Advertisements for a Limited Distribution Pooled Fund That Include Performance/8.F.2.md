# 8.F.2
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose how leverage, derivatives, and short positions have been used historically, if material.
## Discussion
It is recommended that firms provide enough information in a GIPS Advertisement to allow a reader to understand how leverage, derivatives, and short positions have been employed historically and may be used going forward. Although the recommended disclosure of the pooled fund description (Provision [[8.F.1]]) would include disclosure of the firm’s ability to use leverage, derivatives, and short positions, Provision 8.F.2 recommends that the firm disclose how leverage, derivatives, and short positions have been used historically, if material. Taken together, these two recommended disclosures provide a more complete picture of the presence, use, and extent of leverage, derivatives, and short positions.

For example, assume a firm discloses in the pooled fund description that the strategy may employ up to 200% leverage. To satisfy the disclosure recommendation in Provision 8.F.2, the firm might state, “Since the inception of the pooled fund, the leverage has averaged 110% of the pooled fund’s value; however, during 2019, the leverage averaged 160%, which greatly increased the sensitivity to market volatility and the potential for realized gains and/or losses.”

When determining what would be material, the firm must consider whether the disclosure of how leverage, derivatives, and/or short positions have been used historically is likely to affect a reader’s view of the risk involved in the strategy. If so, the firm must consider if it would be misleading to fail to disclose their use when describing the strategy.
