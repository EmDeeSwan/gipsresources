# 8.F.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose the [[BENCHMARK DESCRIPTION]], which MUST include the key features of the [[BENCHMARK]] or the name of the [[BENCHMARK]] for a readily recognized index or other point of reference.
## Discussion
Firms are recommended to disclose a description of each benchmark included in a GIPS Advertisement. The benchmark description is defined as general information regarding the investments, structure, and/or characteristics of the benchmark, and it must include the key features of the benchmark. In the case of a widely recognized benchmark, such as the S&P 500® Index, the name of the benchmark will satisfy this recommendation. (S&P 500® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.) Each firm must decide for itself whether a benchmark is widely recognized. If the firm is not certain as to whether the benchmark is widely known, it is recommended that the firm include the benchmark description.
### Sample Disclosure for a Widely Recognized Benchmark:
“The benchmark is the S&P 500® Index.”
### Sample Disclosure for a Benchmark That Is Not Widely Recognized:
“The custom benchmark return is calculated by applying the investment cash flows of the Armor Distressed Debt Fund to the XYZ Eurozone Distressed Debt Bond Total Return Index. The index reflects a portfolio of euro-denominated distressed debt bonds issued in Eurozone countries that generally have credit ratings of CCC or lower from the main rating agencies and are listed on the XYZ platforms.”
