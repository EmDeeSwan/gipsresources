## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose material differences between the BENCHMARK and the COMPOSITE’S investment mandate, objective, or strategy.
## Discussion
Firms are required to disclose the composite description (see Provision 5.C.4) and the benchmark description (see Provision [[5.C.5]]) in a GIPS Composite Report. It is recommended that firms also disclose any material differences between the benchmark and the composite’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Prospective clients will be better able to evaluate the performance of the strategy relative to the benchmark presented if they understand any material differences between the composite and the benchmark.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The Small-Cap Opportunities Composite is a venture capital composite that invests in small-cap startups in all sectors, with a focus on the health care and financial services sectors. The benchmark for the composite is the public market equivalent (PME) of the ABC Small-Cap Index, which tracks the performance of US small-cap companies. The investment strategy of the composite differs from the small-cap investment strategies represented by the PME because the composite concentrates its investments. As of 31 December 2019, 62% of the composite was invested in the health care and financial services sectors, and 18% of the index was invested in these two sectors.”
