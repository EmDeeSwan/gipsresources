Links: [[5. Composite Money-Weighted Return Report]]
___
# 5.D.9
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose how research costs are reflected in returns.
## Discussion
The focus on research costs has grown in certain markets. Although research costs are often absorbed by the firm, some firms instead charge research costs directly to clients. To allow prospective clients to understand the firm’s policy for the treatment of research costs, firms should disclose if returns do or do not reflect the deduction of research costs.
### Sample Disclosures:
“ABC Company bears the costs of investment research. Research costs are not separately charged to clients.”

“Certain investment research costs are charged directly to clients outside the managed portfolio. Therefore, composite returns do not reflect the research costs that are charged directly to clients.”
