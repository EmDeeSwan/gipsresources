## Standard for Firms
If the [[COMPOSITE]] contains PORTFOLIOS with [[BUNDLED FEE|BUNDLED FEES]], the FIRM SHOULD disclose the types of fees included in the [[BUNDLED FEE]].
## Discussion
A bundled fee is a fee that combines multiple fees into one total or “bundled” fee. Bundled fees can include any combination of investment management fees, transaction costs, custody fees, and/or administrative fees. An example of a bundled fee is an all-in fee, which is a type of bundled fee that can include any combination of investment management fees, transaction costs, custody fees, and administrative fees. All-in fees are typically offered in certain jurisdictions where asset management, brokerage, and custody services are offered by the same company.

To help prospective clients better understand the nature of the fees charged for a particular investment product, and to facilitate comparison of bundled fee products offered by different firms, it is recommended that firms disclose the types of fees included in the bundled fee.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Portfolios within the composite pay a bundled fee, which includes all charges for transaction costs, portfolio management fees, and custody fees.”
