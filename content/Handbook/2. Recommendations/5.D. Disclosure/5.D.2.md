# 5.D.2
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose material changes to calculation policies and/or methodologies.
## Discussion
Firms have discretion to determine which policies and methodologies are used for calculating performance. Although these policies and methodologies must adhere to all applicable calculation requirements, firms may choose from a wide variety of policies and methodologies. Firms may change calculation policies and/or methodologies; however, firms must not change a calculation policy or methodology for the sole purpose of increasing performance. If a change to the calculation policies and/or methodologies is material, firms should disclose the change in order to enable prospective clients to understand the potential effect of such a change.
### Sample Disclosure:
“Prior to 2019, the internal rate of return method was used to calculate since-inception money-weighted returns. Subsequently, the Modified Dietz method is used for all periods.”
