# 7.D.3
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose material differences between the BENCHMARK and the [[POOLED FUND|POOLED FUND’S]] investment mandate, objective, or strategy.
## Discussion
Firms are required to disclose the pooled fund description (see Provision [[7.C.4]]) and the benchmark description (see Provision [[7.C.5]]) in a GIPS Pooled Fund Report. It is recommended that firms also disclose any material differences between the benchmark and the pooled fund’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Prospective investors will be better able to evaluate the performance of the strategy relative to the benchmark presented if they understand any material differences between the pooled fund and the benchmark.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The Small-Cap Opportunities Fund is a venture capital fund that invests in small-cap startups in all sectors, with a focus on the health care and financial services sectors. The benchmark for the Fund is the public market equivalent (PME) of the ABC Small-Cap Index, which tracks the performance of US small-cap companies. The investment strategy of the Fund differs from the small-cap investment strategies represented by the PME because the Fund concentrates its investments. As of 31 December 2019, 62% of the Fund was invested in the health care and financial services sectors, and 18% of the index was invested in these two sectors.”
