# 7.D.4
## Standard for Firms
The FIRM SHOULD disclose the key assumptions used to value investments.
## Discussion
Firms are required to disclose that valuation policies are available upon request. (See Provision [[7.C.14]]) Because valuation is a critical component of the performance calculation, it is recommended that firms also disclose the key assumptions used when valuing pooled fund investments. This will help prospective investors better understand how the firm values investments and compare valuation assumptions for similar strategies used by different firms.
### Sample Disclosure:
“The firm uses valuations reported by the general partners of the underlying pooled funds.”
