## Discussion
Direct investments are investments made directly in companies rather than investments made through pooled fund investments. Co-investments are a type of direct investment in which pooled fund investors invest additional capital alongside the pooled fund’s investments. It is recommended that the firm present the total fair value of the firm’s co-investments related to the pooled fund as of the most recent annual period end. This information will give prospective investors a more complete picture of the nature of the investments related to the pooled fund.
