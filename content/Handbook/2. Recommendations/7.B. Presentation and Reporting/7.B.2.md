# 7.B.2
## Standard for Firms
If the [[POOLED FUND]] has [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]], the FIRM SHOULD present the following items as of each annual period end:
- [[POOLED FUND]] SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]].
- [[POOLED FUND]] SINCE-INCEPTION [[DISTRIBUTION|DISTRIBUTIONS]].
- [[POOLED FUND]] cumulative [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]].
- TOTAL VALUE to SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] ([[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|INVESTMENT MULTIPLE]] or [[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]]).
- SINCE-INCEPTION [[DISTRIBUTION|DISTRIBUTIONS]] to SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] ([[DPI (REALIZATION MULTIPLE)|REALIZATION MULTIPLE or DPI]]).
- SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] to cumulative [[COMMITTED CAPITAL]] ([[PIC MULTIPLE]]).
- RESIDUAL VALUE to SINCE-INCEPTION [[PAID-IN CAPITAL]] (UNREALIZED MULTIPLE or RVPI).
## Discussion
Firms are required to present the pooled fund since-inception money-weighted return (SI-MWR), through the most recent annual period end, as well as the since-inception paid-in capital, since-inception distributions, cumulative committed capital, investment multiple ([[INVESTMENT MULTIPLE (TVPI)|TVPI]]), realization multiple (DPI), PIC multiple, and unrealized multiple (RVPI), as of the most recent annual period end. If firms choose to present additional SI-MWRs through prior annual period ends, firms are recommended to also present the same metrics as of each additional period end for which returns are presented. See Provision [[7.A.4]] for further discussion of these metrics.
