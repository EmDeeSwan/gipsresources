# Preliminary Data
## Question
**We would like to update our GIPS Reports shortly after year end. However, our performance is not finalized until several weeks after year end. We would like to identify the newly-added annual information as “preliminary” and explain that preliminary performance is subject to change until final reconciliations are done. May we do this?**
## Answer
Firms may include preliminary performance in a GIPS Report and identify it as “preliminary” as long as doing so would not result in presenting performance that is false or misleading. Firms are reminded that if any changes in performance or other information in a GIPS Report are made when performance is finalized, the changes are subject to the firm’s error correction policies and procedures.
